That all of my knowledge from calc BC escapes my brain.,AC,The sample exams and quizzes during linear algebra helped out a lot if we could have those for multivariable calc that would be fantastic.,AC
"My only concern about this course is that I will have an issue learning one of the fundamental items early in the course, and as a result of that, will struggle later on when building upon that foundational knowledge. ",AC,NA,NC
"My only concern is if I'll be able to study/prepare to the same degree for exams that I did last semester, but other than that I feel confident.",AC,NA,NC
"My only concern is that so far the video lessons are not as clear as they were in the linear algebra course. This could just be me, though as they are still very comprehensive.",AC,NA,NC
"One thing that was concerning for me last semester was my mastery on certain topics. There were some topics in linear algebra that I couldn't fully explore due to other work and activities. For MV Calc, I hope to fix this issue by writing notes and practice problems down so that I could review it again in depth later.",AC,NA,NC
"Perhaps not putting forth my greatest effort being a victim of senioritis. I've always been a perfectionist, so it is challenging and dreading to imagine not passing a class with flying colors.",PC,NA,NC
"Some concerns may have might be more technical, such as being unable to access the textbook.",TC,NA,NC
Some concerns that I have include encountering difficult content that would delay the process in which I complete assignments for the class.,AC,NA,NC
"Something that concerns me is not being able to learn properly as it is not in person, but I think the studio sessions and recorded lectures will resolve this.",AC,NA,NC
Studying for the exams.,AC,NA,NC
Taking module tests in MML,AC,NA,NC
Technological issues with the gatech instructure portal. ,TC,NA,NC
That I won't do well because of all my other classes. I'm scared I won' succeed and miss a duedate.,AC,NA,NC
That it counts towards my college gpa.,AC,NA,NC
The allocation of the weightage.,AC,NA,NC
The biggest concern I have this semester is preventing sernioritis from taking over and paralyzing my ability to finish work.,AC,NA,NC
The concern I have is the format of the Exams compared to linear algebra.,AC,NA,NC
The effectiveness of studio lessons.,AC,NA,NC
"The exams concern me the most, as I am unsure of the structure of the exams, mainly if they are similar to last semester's course.",AC,NA,NC
The exams since they are given such a large weight.,AC,NA,NC
"The lecture videos this semester skip a number of intermediate steps, so the only mild concern I have right now is being unaware of where numbers may come from during the middle of her solving a problem. ",AC,NA,NC
"The most concern is not fully understanding the content even with the help given, and struggling due to the format and wording of some questions. ",AC,NA,NC
The one thing that concerns me is the high weightage of the exams and final. ,AC,NA,NC
"The percentage for the exams concerns me the most, as the high number puts pressure on students. ",AC,NA,NC
The quick pace of the lecture videos and occasional lack of explanation on a problem. ,AC,NA,NC
There has been some time since I worked on much of the calculus coursework so it may be a little rusty at the start of this semester.,AC,NA,NC
"There's 2 MML courses (old version and new). I did MML1 on the new version, but the grade didn't change in canvas. When I do a question on the old version, the grade updates. ",AC,NA,NC
too much homework,AC,na,NC
What concerns me most about taking the course is that the material may be a little difficult to learn since the course is online. ,AC,NA,NC
What concerns me the most about taking this course is being able to balance the large workload of this class along with the large workload of my other classes in a way that enables me to complete and do well on all this class's assignments while also gaining a strong understanding of the information that we are learning.,AC,NA,NC
What concerns me the most about taking this course is not have sufficient time for completing all the material. It is a very small concern.,AC,NA,NC
"It simply concerns me that I cannot ask my professor questions in person, and is completely at the mercy of both my and the professor's schedule. ",AC,NA. ,NC
I found topics related to LaGrange difficult last year and I feel like it will be hard for me to pick up on the content surrounding it. I will look for extra help from TAs and instructors.,AC,No individual needs. Very excited to learn the topics in Multivariable Calculus. ,NC
"My main concern is this is so so so much more difficult than high school math. It's really quite a jump and catches you off guard at first.

",AC,No nothing much. Matrices are my worst nighPCare and I hope they go away permanently.,NC
"Also, neither the written assignment nor the exams are appearing on my course feed and that is kind of an issue. ",TC,No nothing much. Matrices are my worst nighPCare and I hope they go away permanently.,NC
I probably forgot a lot of calc BC.,AC,None,NC
I want to have more practice taking practice assessments and tests for prep. I want to just have some more additional practice before the actual exams come around.,AC,None,NC
"There might be several topics that rely on prerequisite knowledge that our school didn't address fully, and I am unsure if there is an appropriate calculator for 3D information. Additionally, Exam 3 and the final exam are during school holidays/events/exams, so I'm unsure if that will work out well. ",AC,none,NC
"Nothing that I've seen, but I have heard from several others who have taken the course in the past about the difficulty of this semester.",AC,"None, I am glad there are not quizzes anymore and just MMLs, as they were far more helpful to me in linear algebra :)",NC
I do not have any concerns.,NC,None.,NC
The difficulty. "Multivariable calculus" sounds like a very advanced class.,AC,none.,NC
"One concern for taking this course is having a greater workload, even though the work provided based on the modules is less.",AC,not applicable,NC
The amount of work.,AC,Nothing so far. Just only started. ,NC
The abstractions sometimes scare me,AC,"Nothing, I am very excited!",NC
"I'm afraid I won't be able to retain the information I learn well enough to be able to teach it to someone else. Teaching it to someone else helps me understand better, so I'm afraid that I won't be able to understand to that level.",AC,"The course seems a little more rigorous, but I think if I just reach out when I need help, I'll be alright.",AC
"The concerns that I have taking the course are the varied amount of work that each unit would take and the format of the module tests. For example, I am anxious that the test content may be from a unit that was covered briefly from many lessons ago that I may not have had time to review for.",AC,The course so far is navigable and allows me time to work on the assignment.,NC
"I think I’m most concerned about getting an A in the course and being able to balance the workload with all my other commiPCents. However, I felt the workload with linear algebra was optimal, and I am now finished with college applications, so I doubt that will be too much of a problem.",AC,There is nothing in particular I think you should know about me or my impressions of the course so far.,NC
"The only concern I have is the difficulty with the course knowing that many people have said that it will be very hard. However, I feel like it'll be alright considering my performance in linear algebra. ",AC,There is nothing individually that I would need. I very much like the course so far because of its similarity to the layout of the linear algebra course. ,NC
I do not have any concerns at the moment.,NC,There is nothing so far.,NC
"Last year, I struggled a lot with true and false questions and concerned that I might repeat the same thing this semester.",AC,,NC
The tests being in MML makes them difficult to complete on mobile.,TC,NA,NC
I wish that every single question on the homework had a walk you through it or an example.,AC,N/A,NC
"I would like to focus on retaining the material better, since I find it harder to retain the information as well for online courses.",AC,N/A,NC
I'm a bit worried about the content and the difficulty. ,AC,n/a,NC
"I'm a little concerned as to whether or not I will be able to understand many of the topics we learn about, but I'm also confident that I will put in my best.",AC,N/A,NC
I'm just a little intimidated by how much the exams and final are worth.,AC,N/A,NC
"I'm slightly concerned about preparing from exams, but I know that I can look at practice exams and MML practice to study and ensure that I understand the material.",AC,N/A,NC
"My biggest concern is keeping up with the deadlines especially because the GT breaks do not align with school breaks, so I will make sure to stay on schedule",AC,N/A,NC
"My concern is the extra exam we have compared to last semester. Last semester, there was two exams and the final, but with the extra exam, I am worried about how it will all work out.",AC,N/A,NC
My only concern is if it will add too much to my course load this semester.,PC,N/A,NC
"One concern I have about this course is that I forgot much of what I learned in calculus last year. However, I believe I will able to review the material that is necessary for this course and will regain the skills. ",AC,N/A,NC
One concern or dislike I have is the canvas quizzes are taken away. These helped support my learning and understanding of the content much more. ,AC,N/A,NC
"That it's been a while since I've done calculus. I personally feel it would have been better to have multivar first semester. Unless line alg is a prerequisite, then ignore this.",AC,N/A,NC
The one thing that concerns me the most is the fact that the in-person exams are worth 10% more than in Linear Algebra.,AC,N/A,NC
"The only thing that concerns me about this course is that my calculus foundation is not strong. I believe last semester, my strong algebra foundation helped me a lot in linear algebra but this semester I am concerned about how my weak calculus foundation will impact my learning pace. ",AC,n/a,NC
"The only thing that worries me is that since this is mostly an online class, I might not get as much practice as I should in-person nsetting. Math requires a lot of practice; hence it is important that i get in sufficient practice before any of the assessments.",AC,n/a,NC
"The tests are 60% of our grade, we don't have quizzes anymore, and grades aren't dropped.",AC,N/A,NC
The thing that concerns me the most is having a smaller diversity of practice problems. I don't want to use the exam prep sheets before I begin studying for the exam but I would also like practice problems besides what is on MML. The extra credit webwork will hopefully cover this but it doesn't become available until the 22nd.,AC,N/A,NC
The weight of the exams worries me for getting a good grade.,AC,N/A,NC
"The workload, this is a college class so I will definitely have a lot more work here than in any of my other classes.",AC,N/A,NC
The increased complexity of the actual technical math work compared to linear algebra. I struggled occasionally in BC calculus so multivariable is daunting in comparison.,AC,"N/A, so far, the course feels alright but I will only really know about my impressions on its technical difficulty as we get farther in.",NC
"I feel like the 3 exams concern me since last semester we had 2. Also the final being worth 30% of the grade is a lot in my opinion, since I have never had a test weigh more.",AC,NA,NC
"I got a B last semester and I heard this class can be harder, so I’m worried about that.",AC,NA,NC
I think it's just the leap from weekly homeworks to mass studying a few days before exams.,AC,NA,NC
"I think my time management skills are the most concerning. Preparing well before a test, and studying consistently, I should manage my time well.",PC,NA,NC
I worry about falling behind in content. ,AC,NA,NC
"I'm a bit worried about the in-person examinations as they will now take up 60% of our grade. Other than that, I am not too worried. ",AC,NA,NC
"I'm afraid about the difficulty of this course, but that was also the same for last semester's. Calculus, especially series, was a struggle and I understand that I will do better if I put in more effort, but I still feel like I'm going to stress over learning. ",AC,NA,NC
I'm concerned about the level of importance for the exams (being now 30%) and I'm also worried for the lack of quizzes (since those were helpful).,AC,NA,NC
"I'm concerned the course may move quickly and that I will have to review calculus, which I may have forgotten since last year.",AC,NA,NC
I'm concerned with my calculus knowledge. I took AB and BC last year and havent done much review since. ,AC,NA,NC
I'm most concerned that I will not understand the material being taught and that I won't be able to execute my knowledge during the exams. I hope to mitigate this by consistently doing practice exams to prepare myself for the actual exam. ,AC,NA,NC
I'm worried I might have forgotten some of the stuff that the course expects me to know.,AC,NA,NC
"In linear algebra, I got into a groove with my coursework.  I feel like it is going to be a lot different with this course.  It is a different kind of math, there are no quizzes, there are three exams, and the lecturer is different.  My biggest concern is that the lady on the lecture videos does not do as great of a job as Dr. Mayer did with linear algebra.",AC,NA,NC
"My biggest concern is actually understanding the course content. So far, it seems a decent bit complicated, and I know it's only going to get harder.",AC,NA,NC
"I concerned about getting a B like last semester. Although I feel more confident in this course's material for reasons previously stated, I need to make sure I stay on task and adequately review material.",AC,N/A,NC
"I don't have a lot of concerns about this course, mainly just worrying about how well I'll learn the material. ",AC,N/A,NC
I am slightly concerned for the lack of a practice exam.,AC,I am very excited to be back in a calculus class!,NC
I am concerned about the pace of the course and the difficulty of the concepts taught throughout the course. ,AC,N/A,NC
I am nervous I will think I will understand the topic but ultimately fail the exams.,AC,N/A,NC
"I am concerned about the ""calculus"" portion as it relates to derivatives and integrals - although I was proficient in it, the concept can become quite complex.",AC,N/A,NC
* I'm concerned that I might have some difficulty learning online/not being able to ask questions as easily as I would be able to in a in-person class.,AC,N/A,NC
"As this course is going to mix linear algebra and calculus, I'm worried about the content. However, I plan to attend more studio sessions to fully understand this content. ",AC,N/A,NC
"At this point in the semester, I am most concerned about studying for the exams, as I am worried that my current studying techniques will be ineffective given the amount of content involved in an exam, more specifically the final exam. ",AC,N/A,NC
"At this point in the semester, true and false questions concern me the most in this course, as I do not do as well with conceptual questions. Luckily, Dr. Mayer mentioned that MATH 2551 is less theoretical so I am hoping it will be less difficult this semester.",AC,N/A,NC
I am a bit concerned about the difficulty of the course and the things I will need to do to manage my time with my other classes.,AC,N/A,NC
"I am most concerned about being able to learn online, because I struggled last semester and had to do a lot of group studying to understand some parts.",AC,N/A,NC
I am concerned about the lack of guidance from an in-person teacher. I often rely on asking the teacher questions to improve my understanding of certain concepts.,AC,NA,NC
I am concerned about the lack of quizzes. The quizzes in the linear algebra course helped me test my knowledge and I am not sure why this course does not have any.,AC,NA,NC
"I am concerned because I've heard that this is the hardest of all 4 distance math classes, so I'm scared that I won't understand something and won't do too well given that all exams combined are 60% of our grade.",AC,NA,NC
"I am concerned by the fast-moving pace of the course, but I believe with appropriate practice I will be able to gain a strong information of the content.",AC,NA,NC
I am concerned that I will not understand a concept and it will affect me for the rest of the course.,AC,NA,NC
I am concerned that I will struggle on exams with the lack of quizzes that I can retry like we could last semester. It showed me where to work more and promoted mastery of all subjects.,AC,NA,NC
"I am most concerned about getting behind on my work and getting stressed out, however that did not happen last semester so hopefully it doesn't this semester either. ",PC,NA,NC
I am most concerned about not understanding the course and not doing well on exams.,AC,NA,NC
"I am most concerned with keeping up with the course. There is often much math to cover each week, so it is important that I manage my time well so that I am able to sufficiently understand and apply the material.",AC,NA,NC
I am worried about the exams being worth 60% of the grade this time and I want to make sure I spend an even longer time studying for the exams. I am concerned about making sure I fully learn all the content this semester because I feel like semester it was easy to get by without fully learning the content until the exams. ,AC,NA,NC
"I am worried about the in person exams the most. In linear algebra I struggled to prepare well enough to see results despite studying, so I am worried that I will have the same struggles in this class. ",AC,NA,NC
I am concerned about being able to recall things from Calculus quick enough to understand the new concepts in the course.,AC,NA,NC
I am concerned about how much practice I will have to do using resources outside of the work given by this course once the topics become more complex.,AC,NA,NC
"I am concerned about the exams because they have a much higher weight in this class, and the exams in linear algebra were hard for me. I am also concerned that I lost a lot of my knowledge of BC Calculus since it has been a while. ",AC,NA,NC
Although I said I enjoy the incorporation of physics it also could be a challenge for me. I'm not the greatest at physics but it is just going to have to be part of the process and I'll take more time to understand how to use it in this class. ,AC,NA,NC
"As the last time I had practiced calculus was 8+ months ago, I am a bit worried about my ability to remember the application of certain skills. ",AC,NA,NC
"At this point, I'm not worried about the difficulty of the work, I'm worried about the timing of it since my spring semester looks like it will be busier than fall semester.",AC,NA,NC
Grades,AC,NA,NC
"I am a bit concerned that, unlike Linear Algebra, there are not quizzes due each week. Those quizzes not only helped to bolster my grade, but they were extremely useful to better understanding content. I will likely need to seek other sources for better understanding this semester.",AC,NA,NC
"I am concerned about not learning the content as deeply as I need to. Even after watching lecture videos and reading the textbook and doing the homework, there are still times where I struggle to keep up.",AC,NA,NC
I am concerned about taking another calculus class because I have forgotten just about all of the calculus I took previously.,AC,NA,NC
I am concerned about the fact that the in person exams count for so much grade-wise which means I don't have very much room for error on the exams.,AC,NA,NC
"I am concerned about the lack of quizzes. With linear algebra, I thought that the quizzes helped to reinforce understanding and acted as review material down the line",AC,NA,NC
I am most concerned about not understanding the material.,AC,NA,NC
"I heard some concepts are difficult to grasp, but otherwise no major concerns!",AC,NA,NC
"I tend to struggle with online courses and staying engaged so Im concerned about that. If I'm able to put in the time though, the material should be fairly easy for me.",AC,NA,NC
"I wasn't the best at Calc BC, and continuing calculus is a bit nervous for me, but I'm pretty confident with vectors and their related topics so I'm not too worried.",AC,NA,NC
"I'm mostly concerned about the difficulty- students generally have mixed opinions about the difficulty of Multivariable calculus as compared to Linear Algebra, so I hope that Multi isn't too much more challenging than LinAlg. ",AC,NA,NC
"My concern now is that the exams hold a higher portion in the overall weight grade, but I believe with proper work and attention to learning that shouldn't be a problem. I'm also a bit worried because there are no quizzes each week, so I feel like I can't have that extra review I would normally have to learn. The part that concerns me the most is that we don't have module exams anymore which were helpful to me in the previous semester, but hopefully the kahoots can make up for that.",AC,NA,NC
"Not having enough practice without the weekly quizzes, having to learn harder content, greater amount of grade based on exams.",AC,NA,NC
"Not having weekly quizzes is a concern to me as they were helpful in gauging our knowledge for the exams last semester. Additionally, the percentage of Exam weight is a slight bit of a concern to me as last semester, I wasn't the best at exam-taking. Nonetheless, I will work this semester to be better.",AC,NA,NC
I am worried about having another exam. I did well on exams 1 and 2 during Linear Algebra but they always make me nervous.,AC,NA.,NC
"I'm concerned about not being able to attend the live lessons. Last semester I was able to watch recordings for the first quarter, but then I ended up stop watching the lessons altogether and just relied on the lesson videos and textbook.",PC,"NA. I'll ask a lot of questions, I guess.",NC
"I am a bit scared about how there are three exams this year instead of two like last year, but I know it will work out as long as I work hard.",AC,NA ,NC
"I am also a little worried about the fact that there are fewer assignments, especially with there being no quizzes. This means there will be fewer practices and ""easy"" A's to affect our grades. I am also worried about the fact that there is another exam because exams are not my strong point in this course so this could drop my grade. ",AC,No concerns,NC
"I am concerned about my ability to fully understand the subject material. Math does not come easy to me, especially math at this level. So I am also worried about the time I will have to dedicate to succees. ",AC,None,NC
"Ensuring that I study ""enough"" before the first exam is my main concern, as I am still learning how much time I need to spend reviewing for collegiate level courses such as this one.",AC,None,NC
There are no quizzes every week. I like to use the quizzes for practice and as a checkpoint but now it'll be that much harder to study for the exams. ,AC,Not that I can think of. ,NC
I am most concerned about finishing learning and understanding the content before the exams roll around because there seems to be more content than last semester. ,AC,The first B of my high school career was in Math 1554 so I hope that motivates me to push harder for an A this semester. ,PC
"I am mostly concerned about being able to fully grasp the content, but that is mostly based on my own personal ability to learn and take the time to study for this course.",AC,"There is not really anything special concerning my needs except that my internet at home can sometimes stop working, but I will do my best to not let this issue affect my work in the course.",TC
Being able to pass the exam.,AC,,NC

"I wonder when the difficulty jump will be, because I am aware that it seems to start simple but will get much harder.",AC,I dont have any unique individual needs.,NC
What concerns me the most is staying focused throughout the whole semester to understand the material as my other classes get difficult as well.,AC,I loved AP Calculus so I'm really looking forward to expand my knowledge on calculus even further.,NC
My biggest concern is not knowing all of the assignments or resources I need to utilize. It would be horrible if I found out I missed an assignment or an extra credit opprotunity.,AC,"I might not be able to attend live studio sessions because of after school hours, but I will try to watch all of the recordings.",PC
I just hope I can get a better grasp of concepts than I had last semester so that my grade can better reflect my capabilities.,AC,I struggled a lot last semester as there wasn't really peers I could turn towards for any sort of help as my school has very few people in this course and those people don't really help each other out.,AC
"My concerns include the heavy weight of the exams; however, with disciplined preparation, I believe it is possible to achieve success in this course!",AC,"I tend to get quite nervous before exams; however, I do my best to get help when needed/work my way through problems to get deep understanding of course materials. I believe course material is more spaced out as compared to linear; however, I believe the content is more rigorous, so I will need to ensure that I remain up-to-speed/ahead on all course content!",PC
"It's been a while since I've done any calculus, so I might be rusty on some skills.",AC,I think multivariable calculus will be a more advanced form of calculus that I learned in AP.,AC
My main concern in striving for a A in this class. I find that I struggle to learn something unless I view it in many different lenses (so the videos textbook and studio sessions will definitely help).,AC,I will be in India from Jan 20- Feb 3 and so I will be trying to get ahead in the early weeks of this course.,PC
"I'm just worried about learning everything well enough to apply it in later courses, but hopefully if I watch lectures and studios and do practice problems I won't have an issue with that.",AC,I'm looking forward to the extra credit practice problems.,AC
"Understanding concepts like partial derivatives, multiple integrals, and vector calculus can be difficult for me.

Second, the course may require a significant amount of computational work and problem solving, which can be time-consuming and challenging.",AC,I'm very interested in physics and this class will definitely help pursue my passion in that field.,PC
My biggest concern is my ability to learn the material and pace myself. This semester will be more hectic than last semester making it more difficult to dedicate time to learning the material. ,AC,I've learned a lot from the first segment of distance math in terms of what to expect with assignments and pacing so I'm not as worried about that this time around. One thing that I will be experiencing this semester is going to India for two weeks for a family event which may interfere with the course. ,PC
"Something that concerns me is how everything builds in this unit. Like if I don't understand one unit, then it'll snowball into other units not ending up too well. ",AC,"Math is somewhat of a struggle for me, but I'll try my best this semester!!",PC
I'm concerned with how it is based heavily on Calculus especially considering how difficult BC calculus was last year. I'm also scared that we will be expected to remember things from last year that I might not remember how to do. This course is also said to be covering more than Linear Algebra so it will go faster and I'm scared that I will get lost or confused or that it might go too fast for me. I think the breakdown of the Linear Algebra course really helped me so I am going to try to follow and trust the breakdown of this course as well. ,AC,"My impression of the course so far is pretty good. I've heard that it is less theoretical and thus less complicated than the linear algebra course. I am looking forward to solving more porblems instead of memorizing rules and definitions. I am a little overwhlemed by the amount of content we will cover but I believe that as we go through it, I'll be alright with the piece by piece.  ",AC
What concerns me the most about taking this course is the proximity of the exams in terms of time.,AC,My impression of the course so far is that it is a self-taught course. ,AC
My ability to stay focused and perform in an online setting.,AC,My main concern has been keeping up with the work and managing studying.,PC

"I am most concerned about getting behind like last semester and doing things the day they are due, so I am going to try and stay better on track this semester. I am also concerned about retaining all of the information for subsequent courses.",AC,I am very excited to see how linear algebra and multi build on each other and our understanding of mathematics. I am a little worried about taking the exams on different days but I have been talking to my facilitator and you.,AC
"I am concerned about falling behind the daily videos, as I struggled with this towards the end of last semester in Linear Algebra.",AC,"I believe that this course will be really fun/enjoyable, or at least more so than linear algebra as that was more conceptual and I enjoy being able to visualize the math functions",NC
"From my experience last semester, I felt very unprepared for the final and did not receive the grade that I wanted. Besides that, this course seems reasonable so far. ",AC,I have heard alot about MVC from prior friends who have already taken this course and it seems like a very interesting course. I was very proficient at calculus and want to learn more about the subject as a whole considering more variables. ,AC
"I am concerned about balancing the work needed for this course with other classes and extracurriculars. I have also heard that this course is more difficult than linear algebra, which worries me somewhat.",AC,I look forward to completing this course and learning about multivariable calculus.,NC
I am concerned about understanding the topic and receiving an A. ,AC,I may need some assistance at some point or will have questions later in the course. ,PC
"I am concerned with my ability to master the material on my own. I feel I can do well on the quizzes, but I feel less confident on the true and false questions. I sometimes have trouble with the theoretical questions.",AC,I really appreciate it when extra practice is posted for review before tests and exams.,AC
I have no concerns about this course. ,NC,Everything so far has been quite simple. I have no individual needs towards the course. ,AC

None.,NC,"Last year, I enjoyed AP Calculus AB/BC, and I am excited to continue enriching my knowledge of calculus.",AC
"I am concerned about how much of linear algebra content will be used in this course, That was not a good course for me.",OT,I am excited to begin this course! No other concerns.,NC
"I am a bit worried because due to my work, I miss many of the studio sessions and while I ant to complete the worksheets and watch the videos, I have trouble effectively checking my work. A centralized location with all of the studio worksheet answers would be very useful especially when I redo the worksheets to prepare for the final exam.",OT,I'm excited to start!,NC
"I have heard that MVC has a heavier workload than Linear Algebra. If this is true, I hope to manage my time wisely to get everything done in a punctual manner,",PC,"I am really excited to delve into this course. AP Calculus AB/BC has been my favorite high school class thus far, and I am looking forward to exploring the different concepts that MVC will expand on this semester.",AC
"In the end of my senior year of high school, balancing the rigor of this course with all of the other assignments I have due in my other classes, studying for AP tests, and getting ready for college will make this class challenging for me, but I am excited to take the class on as long as I maintain good, healthy study strategies.",PC,I believe all that would come up is just coordinating when to take exams with the other students at my school taking this class. I remember one of the exams had to be administered to my school a few days after it was to most other students. Organizing exam dates will be something I will need to be proactive about.,TC
I'm concerned about falling behind on assignments and not being able to catch up.,PC,"I often can't get notifications for my GT email to work, so I may miss some things.",TC
I worry about my procrastination habits.,PC,I think I will need additional resources regarding word problems and conceptual work because that was my weakest area in Linear Algebra.,AC
Keeping up with weekly work and avoiding procrastination.,PC,I think linear algebra has served as a good prerequisite to multivariable calc due to its applications in this spring course.,AC
I am a little concerned about falling behind the schedule and then having to rush to learn the concepts. I will try to maintain a consistent work session to ensure I perform my best however.,PC,I am enjoying the course so far and believe that if I need any help that I can access it easily through studio sessions and Piazza.,AC
"I think I am concerned about understanding the content and managing my time. I want to be able to fully understand each of the lessons, but I'm scared that I might not be able to. I'm also worried about finding the time to watch all the lessons and do adequate practice for each of them. ",PC,I don't think there's anything that I need from you specifically. I think I just have to learn to manage my time and get my assignments done to be successful in this class. ,PC
"I am concerned that I will get sidetracked by other things such as my IB exams and not give this course the attention it needs. However, I am currently preparing to make sure that does not happen. ",PC,I love the class!,NC
Right now I‚Äôve been sick with a fever since Friday last week so my main concern is not starting the semester already behind on work due to my illness.,PC,NA,NC
Not having a textbook to reference practice,AC,Hopefully it is less memorization than linear algebra,AC
"I'm still trying to see the TEAMS channel, but other than that, maybe that I need to refresh some of the Calculus skills and angle identities...",AC,NA,NC
I'm most concerned about the fact that our exams are 60% of our grade. This feels like a lot of pressure to put on a few tests.,AC,NA,NC
"I wasn't the biggest fan of AP Physics I (it was very difficult for me and I couldn't understand the concepts) and from the videos I've seen so far, this course reminds me of physics. When I took physics I was a sophomore and I'm a senior now who understands more math, but I'm still a little scared that I won't understand some stuff.

I'm also worried this course will be harder than linear algebra.",AC,NA,NC
Time management throughout this course.,PC,NA,NC
"Time management is my biggest concern, as well as stress. I'm hoping that I'm able to grasp the concepts in a timely manner, since geometric interpretation and thinking in 3 dimensions wasn't my strongest suit in previous years. I also hope I don't become overwhelmed with work and studying for this class.",PC,NA,NC
Time management,PC,NA,NC
The thing that most concerns me is the exam dates and shaping various extracurriculars around them.,AC,NA,NC
"The only thing that concerns me is the online nature of the course, which might make it harder for me to keep up with things because I won't be reminded of this class as much as I'm used to for other classes. Hopefully making a calendar will help.¬†",AC,NA,NC
"The only concern is that I will forget about assignments being due, but I plan on using an agenda to keep up with them.",AC,"I do not have any specific needs for the course so far, but I will email if I do.",NC

My only concern is hoping to pace myself and not get behind on work since it's online.,PC,NA,NC
"My nerves and staying on task. I feel like I understand the material but I let my nerves get the best of me which impacts how I do on my exams. Furthermore, sometimes my weeks are really busy and I don't get time to work on the assignments and have to rush them. I want to space out my time better.¬†",PC,NA,NC
"My main concern with taking this course is time management, as it is self-paced, but because all of the lecture videos are available, I believe this will not be a large problem.",PC,N/A,NC
"My main concern is the amount of time I will have to dedicate to this course as I will be more busy this year, so I will have to work to utilize my time more efficiently.",PC,"My impression of the course if very positive and gives me a good impression of the college experience overall, as it is much more structured than I anticipated.",NC
My main concern is meeting all deadlines and not being overwhelmed by the work. I feel like I can achieve this by working ahead at the start to give myself a buffer and avoid falling behind.,PC,N/A,NC
My main concern is keeping motivation for the course and keeping myself on track so I don't have too much last minute work.,PC,NA,NC

"I worry about my ability to time manage this course well. Last semester, it was difficult for me to keep on track with the weekly content. I plan on managing my time better this semester and trying to keep on track. I do not want to get overwhelmed like last semester. I also worry about how the new grade weights for our assignments will affect us as there is another exam than last semester. I hope I can perform well for this last semester.",PC,NA,NC
I want to make sure I am on top of deadlines. I need to ensure that I sync my Canvas calendar with my google calendar.,PC,Looking forward to learning from you Dr. Mayer. Appreciate all of your support this semester and last.,NC
"I think my biggest concern is time management. Last semester, I did a really terrible job of managing my time because I was busy with college applications and other things. It was easy for me to forget about this class sometimes because of its asynchronous nature. I am really, really, really making sure that I manage my time well enough so that I can dedicate enough time to this class to not only pass but to really engage with the content (if that makes sense).",PC,"I think this is going to be a really fun class!

Dr. Mayer mentioned in the welcome video that this course would be moving at a faster pace than the last semester of Distance Math (Linear Algebra NC554) and I was only able to make an average B in that course. I do not think I am at risk of making a lower grade in this course, but it would be good to bring my grade up to an A (especially given my plans to secure the Hope Scholarship and gain a secure understanding of this material for further courses that require it.)",AC,N/A,NC

"The first unit seems to have a number of physics related aspects, which was a class I struggled in more than most.",AC,NA,NC
The Final Exam,AC,NA,NC
The exams since in linear algebra the practice exams didn't help with the final exam and I was forced to remember all the content that I had studied outside of the practice exams.¬†,AC,NA,NC

One of my concerns includes balancing this rigorous class with other classes at my school and extracurriculars.¬†,PC,NA,NC
One concern I have about this course is my ability to fully learn and comprehend all the material through an online format. This is my first online class and adjusting to this online class was difficult for me the first semester.,PC,NA,NC

However, the only worry I have with the class is the ability to visualize the multivariable functions, as well as extend the ideas of differentiation and integration to multiple dimensions.",PC,"I must admit, linear algebra has been quite a journey for me. The abstract concepts and the depth of the material made it challenging, but I embraced the struggle and managed to grasp most of it. Now, as we delve into multivariable calculus, I can't help but feel a bit anxious. However, I hope to learn the most out of your teachings and look forward to the class.",PC
I'm worried about my comprehension of the material.,PC,N/A,NC

I looked ahead to some of the later concepts, like triple integrals, and I'm concerned I won't be able to understand them.",PC,"The course seems pretty hard and involved, and I'm worried I won't have enough practice, which I benefit from immensely, for assessments. Practice is often the way where I internalize concepts and ideas.",PC

I'm a little worried about multivariable calculus in general and understanding the concepts. It also seems as if there will be a lot more formulas in this class as compared to linear algebra so I'll really have to work on memorizing all of them.,PC,N/A,NC
I'm a little nervous because I'm not sure if I remember everything from my Calculus BC class from last year. So I might need to do some individual review to make sure I am ready for the new content that builds off of what I learned last year.,PC,I would like to know about the connection between this class to my last calculus class and what are the most important topics to review that we will build off of the most.,AC

While there is a dedicated period at my school for this class, there is no one making sure I watch the videos and do the assignments on time, instead everything is up to me.

"My main concern is that I am not learning as well, since it is hard to have collaborative learning when you are at home.",AC,"The course seems pretty tough, but I think I will be able to manage. I'm still a little confused as to the application of all this, and why we describe linear equations in ways like consistency, uniqueness, dependency, etc. I'm trying to understand what the real-world interpretations of all these descriptors would be.",PC
Learning without active instructional time for questions and proofs and just better engagement will be difficult for me.

Im excited to drive into more interesting theorems and applicable math. ",NC
"The material in this course is quite new and unfamiliar to me, so my main concern is with mastering the content without the assistance of a physical teacher and an in-person class. The work requires lots of reading and time commitment in order to review the textbook material and the video lectures, which is something I am mindful of as I manage my time.",AC,"The course at first seems a little daunting without a physical teacher being present, and that this course is unlike any other math course I have taken before. There are a lot of theorems and concepts to know, and I feel that it will get easier with a little bit of practice. I love that the professors, TAs, and students are doing as much as possible to build a sense of community though this is a remote course.",NC
None for now. ,NC,Not for now,NC

"The few concerns that I have are:

1. Me falling behind in the coursework when the exams are closing in.

2. Me not finishing my work on time due to procrastination if that happens.

3. Me not fully understanding the concepts, which can be resolved through the studio sessions and through piazza.",PC,"This course is highly theoretical, which makes it confusing when not understanding a great amount of it. On the contrary, I feel this course is very interesting and I like how it flows and that I work on my own time, I like the freedom.",AC
"I'm concerned that I will accidentally miss an assignment or good study material. I find the syllabus incredibly helpful, but I am still struggling to keep track of the many different websites used for content. ",AC,I find the video content helpful but I don't think it always matches the content covered in the quizzes or homework. I enjoy the way the homework and quizzes are currently set up as it helps me actually learn the material. ,AC
Not having a teacher present at all times to answer any questions I may have.,NC,There is nothing at the moment.,NC
"Not much. The exams mostly. I took CS1301 as Dual Enrollment in the spring, so  I feel comfortable using most of the online resources. ",NC,"Seems like interesting stuff so far, but it feels like a lot of trial and error going from the lectures to the homework. ",NC
N/A,NC,I quite like the teaching/grading style of this course so far. It seems to focus more on the actual learning of the material rather than the minute changes in numbers in the grade book as high school has always seemed to be.,NC
My only concern is that I will not be able to get answers to my questions as they arise. ,AC,The course seems well designed and the lectures are mostly easy to follow. ,NC

However, I am still very interested and invested in this class. I am working to open these slots in my schedule for me to attend these sessions. I am also viewing the studio recordings. 

 

I hope that not attending the studio sessions has reflected poorly on me as a student.",PC
Worried that I might get behind or not be able to receive the help that I need. Mainly that I will procrastinate and get behind. ,AC,,NC

"Not being able to ask questions to a teacher while learning and not having enough practice problems to work through. Usually, my math classes involve 10-15 minutes of lecture followed by 30 mins of doing practice problems.",AC,"Nothing I need you to know, but my first impression is that the content is very interesting!",NC
I don't really have any worries as I worked remotely all of sophomore year and I haven't had any trouble so far.,NC,I don't have any particular needs that should be addressed. My impressions have been that the course content should not be very hard so long as I keep up with the work and videos.,AC

"I'm concerned about the proctored tests. I've tried to look at the example tests available online, but they're not loading or showing up. I'm still looking around Canvas to figure it out soon. One of my main concerns, though, is about retaining the concepts from the lessons. I understand most of this is personal study time and planning for exams.",AC,I am pretty easy going with most things. One thing I would like you to know is that my school in general has a lot of breaks throughout the year. Most of these breaks are spread throughout the year thankfully. I will be diligent in communicating with the course director in case there are any conflicting issues. ,PC

"My only concern is if I will be able to get help if I need it. Because of the way my schedule works (I am a year-round swimmer), I can attend very few of the office hours or studio sessions. I hope that piazza should cover most, if not all, of the questions I may/will have. I know that I have resources available to me to make sure I am able to get help, it is just a bit uncomfortable for me to come from previous math classes where I have asked a lot of in person questions to somewhere where it is much different process to get the same kind of help.",TC,Not that I can think of.,NC
"I have no concerns, as I work well over video lessons.",NC,I do not believe so,NC

Only concern that I have right now is the internet connection. Internet connection is sometimes very bad at my house.,TC,I like this course already! I feel like this class is very organized. I also like your video lectures; it is very easy to understand and follow.,NC
My only concerns are (1) making sure I'm showing my work the correct way and (2) making sure I don't miss tiny but important details.,AC,The material and assignments are set up really nicely; to be nitpicky I wish I could start on the Written Assignments ahead of time but it's not a real concern or issue in any way.,NC
I'm worried that I am going to have a hard time understanding the content. I usually do best with an in person teacher but I really wanted to challenge myself this year. I'm lucky to have a teacher at school I can get help from if I need it but it's not the same as being in class.,AC,"I like the course so far. The lecture videos are incredibly helpful, as are the studio sessions.",NC
N/A,NC,"The videos are pretty helpful so far and in tandem with MyMathLab, I shouldn't have too many problems with the course at this point, although some of the later stuff looks a little intimidating, butthat comes with every math course.",NC

"Just the lack of the in person experience that helps me learn, but technology-wise everything seems very organized and good!",PC,"It seems very conceptual which will be a different change from my previous math courses, and it is definitely hard.

I will work hard to get that A!",AC
"Lately my house has been having internet problems (which may or may not have just been resolved this past week), so we have been frequently losing internet connection for minutes at a time. This could affect my ability to participate in studio sessions or complete timed assessments, but so far it has been okay and I don't think it would cause any other significant problems.",TC,"I have to attend the 5:00pm studio sessions on Mondays and Wednesdays because I already have a class during the morning ones. But I also have dance classes starting at 5:30pm on those days, so I have to either miss participating in the live studio session or arrive late to dance class. (So far I've opted for the latter).

The unlimited attempts on certain assignments (at this point in time, at least) is reassuring because it makes starting the course a little less intimidating.",PC
"I am most concerned with getting a proper understanding of the material. I know I will read all the assigned textbook pages, watch all the prerecorded lectures, and do my homework on time, but I have never taken such a difficult class strictly online before (except for parts of classes during the covid lockdowns), and I hope this online setting still allows me to get a deep understanding of the material.",AC,"I am enjoying the course so far.

"Personally, I tend to be an individual learner and have taken online classes before, so I don't think it will be a significant problem taking this class remotely. It won't be a complete college experience, and getting feedback from a teacher will be more difficult and slower than a live lecture, but I think the studio session should help with that. Staying focused and on track may be a bit difficult with the flexible schedule. ",PC,"I definitely think the studio sessions are helpful to clarify concepts from the lectures, and the piazza forum is helpful for all students. I am still a little uncertain about the role of the textbook in the class. The lectures seem to cover basically everything from the corresponding textbook pages, so I'm a little unsure if the textbook will be helpful.

The last time I took a math course digitally was in 8th grade during the pandemic and although it was just Algebra II and Geometry, it was still very challenging for me because I did not have a physical teacher in front of me who would help me learn and notice when the class does not understand the concepts.

Would it be okay to come in during office hours to ask for an explanation of certain theorems or concepts that don't make sense to me or are there other tools that could better assist me? Once I understand a concept mentally, I am able to apply it. Oftentimes, however, I don't understand what I'm doing, but I'll get it right which isn't helpful in the long run, for comprehension, and/or for tests.

To a lesser degree I also worry about staying on top of the class but I have been good about that thus far.,AC,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the textbook for the class thus far and I think it presents the material in a very clear manner with useful examples. I also really like the way the course is structured; the ability to do assignments at your own pace and being able to check answers/consult resources is very nice and makes the process less stressful. Being able to attempt as many times as necessary and with no time constraint is great because it lets you focus only getting the question right and understanding it. Written assignments also seem helpful as they address one of my concerns earlier with the tests; I am hoping that the feedback and practice will prepare me for how to format things on exams.

"It's not too big of a concern, but one nonetheless: I will have a hard time attending office hours and studios due to the schedule in which they follow. I can always watch back the videos, but also being online will not have the same directness that in-person teaching can provide. If there are any other external resources (anything aside from reading the textbook, watching lectures, studios) that could help, please include a list somewhere accessible (specifically anything that could explain concepts differently, altered wording, changed perspective, etc.). I have yet to find myself needing it, but it may be useful in the future. Other students may need it as well.",AC,"I have eye irritation and dryness, so spending extended periods of time on a computer is not recommended for me. I always have eye drops on hand, wear my glasses when using a device, and take 10-20 minute breaks for every 3-4 hours or so on a light-emitting device. However, I am usually able to complete my coursework in a timely manner since I have gotten used to work plans and breakdowns over the years (and the work so far has definitely proved to be manageable). That being said, it should not be of too much concern, but I just wanted to let you know in case I have few bad eye days and cannot complete assignments on time. Bad days usually consist of headaches, fever, irritation, dryness/constant blinking/blurry vision, pulsating/pressure, etc. that warrants lots of cognitive rest. I should still be fine on proctored exam days. ",PC

The lack of further explanation from the professor when confused and having to rely on peers to collectively understand the material to the full extent.,AC,"I feel as though there needs to be greater explanation of each topic, specifically definitions. For example, linear independence and dependence I feel should have a visual that helps describe what IS and what it MEANS to be linearly independent/dependent.

Games are 2 days a week and typically last from 4-8. Therefore, time will be a large constraint on me until mid-October. I am under the impression that this course is very rigorous and I will try my best to submit all my assignments on time, though I am somewhat nervous because of my packed schedule. ",PC
"I don't think myself as a great self-study learner, and I prefer being in class with a teacher that can readily respond to questions on the spot. Office hours certainly do help, but the immediate feedback is what helps me learn best. Also, the videos are really nice because I was more used to self-studying based on textbooks, so the Dr. Mayer talk through is extremely helpful. ",AC,"Not really, but I do like the pacing of the course and the videos are very clearly explained. I like how Dr. Mayer goes through examples at the end of each lesson because examples are perhaps one of the best things that consolidates information and builds intuition. ",NC

I prefer learning in person more, but I am capable of learning by myself digitally. I am glad that I have my friends in person to support and help me whenever I am confused.

Other concerns for this class are just being able to manage time well and understanding everything in an excellent manner. Time management is something we have to work on, but I am scared that as the class progresses, the course material will become too difficult to the point where I won't be able to move on since I will not understand things completely.

These are my biggest concerns.",PC,"My first impression of the course was that it was a bit unorganized at the start. We were given so much to consider and look at from the beginning, and I was overwhelmed very quickly. However, as it is only the 2nd week, I feel that I am starting to get the hang of things.

Regarding my individual needs, I think I learn better with more explanations and frequent concept reminders. This is probably done well in the studio sessions. Unfortunately, due to how my morning class schedule and afternoon schedule are arranged, I have been unable to attend one.",AC

Falling behind because I don't have a class that I attend frequently in person,AC,This course seems like it requires a lot of practice to learn all the material properly.,AC
"I learn best when collaborating with other students, for example, hearing concepts in the words of kids my age, and trying to explain concepts different ways to other students, and working problems as a collective. Although I have a solid group at school of kids taking this class, I am a little nervous since I do most of my work for this class alone. However I feel like training myself to learn more independently will be a very useful skill for college, and I'm looking forward to the challenge.

I have wifi at home thankfully so this shouldn't be too much of an issue, but I'm used to doing work from other classes during downtime in my school day which I have a lot of, so not being able to do work for this class at school is mildly frustrating.",PC,"I've never taken a math course online, or one that is as conceptual as I've been told this class is, so I'm not really sure what kind of support I need in the moment. However, I will probably try and sit in on office hours somewhat regularly because typically in my math courses, hearing concepts explained numerous times helps solidify material in my head.",AC

"Collaborating with other students often helps me better understand the material, so I am slightly concerned that an online platform can't quite replicate that. While there are platforms to communicate with others it doesn't quite match the benefits of face-to-face collaboration. ",AC,"There is nothing I can think of that I need individually. So far, the course has been going pretty well, but it is definitely an adjustment switching to a completely online platform. ",NC

I'm not too concerned with much. I'm only worried that I may not understand the material as thoroughly due to the nature of this course.,AC,"There's not much, though I think this course is pretty interesting so far.",NC
I am concerned that I may not always be able to get as much help as I may need. I enjoy interacting and asking questions in-person more than on a video conferencing platform or on an online forum as the feedback is instant and I can easily work on the problem in front of the person I am asking the question to. ,AC,"I feel this course will be more difficult than Calculus BC last year as I do not have previous knowledge about the content. Additionally, I struggling a lot with asynchronous learning during Covid, but hopefully I will do better this time around as I have in-person classmates that can help me clarify confusing topics. As of what I've experienced so far, it is definitely a challenging course.",AC
"One of my primary fears is that I am going to fall behind or that not having a specific class time will make accomplishing assignments at home more difficult. So far I have found that doing all my notes, textbook readings, and lecture videos at home has made it harder for me to distinguish my ""class/lecture"" time from my homework time. That aspect has made it a little difficult for me to pick up the information and remember subjects well because I feel like every day I have picked up new material but haven't given myself the time to work with the other stuff and practice it. However, I think throughout the course this issue will be resolved as I get into a rhythm and establish a routine.

On another note, I am also afraid of exams and being fully prepared for those. ",AC,"I ask a lot of questions. I get really anxious and nervous about a lot of stuff, and asking questions is a good opportunity for me to confirm information and calm myself. I know it is pretty standard for students to ask questions, but I just felt obligated to let you know since it might be a little more than average. Anyway, I'm just going to need that time and space to ask questions in order for me to be comfortable with this course and the material. (However, this course seems to provide a lot of opportunities to ask questions and reach out, so I am excited about that! You and your team are doing an excellent job in that department!)",PC

I plan on doing some of the textbook practice questions at the end of some textbook sections. I believe that this course is very well-designed and easy to understand for people who choose to learn digitally. ,AC
I don't,NC,"First just wanted to say I love this course and the topic. Also, I am duel enrolled(my high school is homeschool) through Gatech for math and KSU for other classes, so I don't have to worry about having to coordinate the class time with the ""high school""",NC

One of the biggest concerns I have is with communication. It is easy to miss emails that could potentially have important information. This can be alleviated by checking emails frequently.,TC,The course has been very different than traditional math classes as it does not directly build on stuff from Calc 1.,AC
Just falling behind,PC,None really,NC
"I do not have any concerns about taking this class remotely. I have already taken multiple classes remotely, and some of them have covered math.",NC,"I am enjoying this course! I already have some understanding of linear algebra since I took a quantum computation course over the summer. My teacher expected us to already know linear algebra going into it, so she reviewed a lot of concepts on the very first lecture. Because I was quite confused, I watched the entire 3Blue1Brown series on the topic, and it definitely helped me. I feel like that experience has made this course go quite smoothly for me so far, though I have definitely learned more technical parts of linear algebra.",NC
"I am currently attending Fulton Science Academy Private School. This might not be a concerns with a seniors, but while juniors might be highly affected. The school is enforcing a school MacBook only in school policy, meaning that the students are not allowed to bring their personal laptop in any means. They are enforcing this policy to ensure the student's online safety and stay in school related materials while on school premise.

This would make some of the additional practice material not available - for example the YouTube channel that the T.A. has mentioned during the Studio classes. 

While this might not be a greatest concern, this is still an issue that we confront - that we are not able to use the YouTube videos while we are group studying on the school premise. ",TC,"For now, it was kind of hard for me to access the online Pearson textbook because this was my first time accessing it - I needed my Year 2 friend to help me where the textbook was.

However, I did my freshmen year entirely remote, so I'm somewhat used to the experience.",AC,"All my needs are being met at this point. The course has been well structured and organized so far; the only think that might make things easier for students in my opinion is to put the material needed for the next week's Monday 8AM lecture in the week before's module, so students have a better idea of what they need to know for the worksheet in the lecture.",AC

With more practice, everything should be fine, but that is my major concern right now.",AC,"Not really. Other than being able to move along without a complete comprehension of the material, my other worry is that I won't have enough time, or that I will eat into time for other things, with the amount of studying I see in my future.

,NC,"Honestly the videos are a little confusing at times. I think it is because when explaining things, formal definitions are used rather than explaining the actual concept. Also there aren't very many examples (usually only one), and they aren't explained thoroughly enough when there are (ex: steps are skipped, assumptions are made about what we already know).

For the first week, going from the videos to the Canvas quiz and MML was very confusing  because the videos did not give exposure to the types of questions in those assignments-- we had to figure it out on our own either by looking at the example problem on Math Lab, asking a friend, or by watching supplemental videos. 

Formal definitions are not bad, but there should be simplified versions as well to help us understand.

"My main concern would be falling behind on work since I will have more responsibility for pacing myself. However, now that I have gotten a planner and set up a calendar for myself, I do not think this will be an issue. Other than that, I have no other concerns about taking this class remotely.",AC,"For impressions, I would say that I am rather intimidated by taking the course since I know nothing of linear algebra and have no prior knowledge.

However, I am confident in my abilities and I believe that I will be just fine. Other than that, my individual needs really just encapsulate watching the lectures, taking notes, and doing plenty of practice problems to get better.",AC
