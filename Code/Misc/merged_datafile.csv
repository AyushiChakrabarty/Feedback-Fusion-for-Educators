That all of my knowledge from calc BC escapes my brain.,AC,The sample exams and quizzes during linear algebra helped out a lot if we could have those for multivariable calc that would be fantastic.,AC
"My only concern about this course is that I will have an issue learning one of the fundamental items early in the course, and as a result of that, will struggle later on when building upon that foundational knowledge.",AC,NA,NC
"My only concern is if I'll be able to study/prepare to the same degree for exams that I did last semester, but other than that I feel confident.",AC,NA,NC
"My only concern is that so far the video lessons are not as clear as they were in the linear algebra course. This could just be me, though as they are still very comprehensive.",AC,NA,NC
"One thing that was concerning for me last semester was my mastery on certain topics. There were some topics in linear algebra that I couldn't fully explore due to other work and activities. For MV Calc, I hope to fix this issue by writing notes and practice problems down so that I could review it again in depth later.",AC,NA,NC
"Perhaps not putting forth my greatest effort being a victim of senioritis. I've always been a perfectionist, so it is challenging and dreading to imagine not passing a class with flying colors.",PC,NA,NC
"Some concerns may have might be more technical, such as being unable to access the textbook.",TC,NA,NC
Some concerns that I have include encountering difficult content that would delay the process in which I complete assignments for the class.,AC,NA,NC
"Something that concerns me is not being able to learn properly as it is not in person, but I think the studio sessions and recorded lectures will resolve this.",AC,NA,NC
Studying for the exams.,AC,NA,NC
Taking module tests in MML,AC,NA,NC
Technological issues with the gatech instructure portal.,TC,NA,NC
That I won't do well because of all my other classes. I'm scared I won' succeed and miss a duedate.,AC,NA,NC
That it counts towards my college gpa.,AC,NA,NC
The allocation of the weightage.,AC,NA,NC
The biggest concern I have this semester is preventing sernioritis from taking over and paralyzing my ability to finish work.,AC,NA,NC
The concern I have is the format of the Exams compared to linear algebra.,AC,NA,NC
The effectiveness of studio lessons.,AC,NA,NC
"The exams concern me the most, as I am unsure of the structure of the exams, mainly if they are similar to last semester's course.",AC,NA,NC
The exams since they are given such a large weight.,AC,NA,NC
"The lecture videos this semester skip a number of intermediate steps, so the only mild concern I have right now is being unaware of where numbers may come from during the middle of her solving a problem.",AC,NA,NC
"The most concern is not fully understanding the content even with the help given, and struggling due to the format and wording of some questions.",AC,NA,NC
The one thing that concerns me is the high weightage of the exams and final.,AC,NA,NC
"The percentage for the exams concerns me the most, as the high number puts pressure on students.",AC,NA,NC
The quick pace of the lecture videos and occasional lack of explanation on a problem.,AC,NA,NC
There has been some time since I worked on much of the calculus coursework so it may be a little rusty at the start of this semester.,AC,NA,NC
"There's 2 MML courses (old version and new). I did MML1 on the new version, but the grade didn't change in canvas. When I do a question on the old version, the grade updates.",AC,NA,NC
too much homework,AC,na,NC
What concerns me most about taking the course is that the material may be a little difficult to learn since the course is online.,AC,NA,NC
What concerns me the most about taking this course is being able to balance the large workload of this class along with the large workload of my other classes in a way that enables me to complete and do well on all this class's assignments while also gaining a strong understanding of the information that we are learning.,AC,NA,NC
What concerns me the most about taking this course is not have sufficient time for completing all the material. It is a very small concern.,AC,NA,NC
"It simply concerns me that I cannot ask my professor questions in person, and is completely at the mercy of both my and the professor's schedule.",AC,NA.,NC
I found topics related to LaGrange difficult last year and I feel like it will be hard for me to pick up on the content surrounding it. I will look for extra help from TAs and instructors.,AC,No individual needs. Very excited to learn the topics in Multivariable Calculus.,NC
"My main concern is this is so so so much more difficult than high school math. It's really quite a jump and catches you off guard at first.

",AC,No nothing much. Matrices are my worst nighPCare and I hope they go away permanently.,NC
"Also, neither the written assignment nor the exams are appearing on my course feed and that is kind of an issue.",TC,No nothing much. Matrices are my worst nighPCare and I hope they go away permanently.,NC
I probably forgot a lot of calc BC.,AC,None,NC
I want to have more practice taking practice assessments and tests for prep. I want to just have some more additional practice before the actual exams come around.,AC,None,NC
"There might be several topics that rely on prerequisite knowledge that our school didn't address fully, and I am unsure if there is an appropriate calculator for 3D information. Additionally, Exam 3 and the final exam are during school holidays/events/exams, so I'm unsure if that will work out well.",AC,none,NC
"Nothing that I've seen, but I have heard from several others who have taken the course in the past about the difficulty of this semester.",AC,"None, I am glad there are not quizzes anymore and just MMLs, as they were far more helpful to me in linear algebra :)",NC
I do not have any concerns.,NC,None.,NC
The difficulty. "Multivariable calculus" sounds like a very advanced class.,AC,none.,NC
"One concern for taking this course is having a greater workload, even though the work provided based on the modules is less.",AC,not applicable,NC
The amount of work.,AC,Nothing so far. Just only started.,NC
The abstractions sometimes scare me,AC,"Nothing, I am very excited!",NC
"I'm afraid I won't be able to retain the information I learn well enough to be able to teach it to someone else. Teaching it to someone else helps me understand better, so I'm afraid that I won't be able to understand to that level.",AC,"The course seems a little more rigorous, but I think if I just reach out when I need help, I'll be alright.",AC
"The concerns that I have taking the course are the varied amount of work that each unit would take and the format of the module tests. For example, I am anxious that the test content may be from a unit that was covered briefly from many lessons ago that I may not have had time to review for.",AC,The course so far is navigable and allows me time to work on the assignment.,NC
"I think I知 most concerned about getting an A in the course and being able to balance the workload with all my other commiPCents. However, I felt the workload with linear algebra was optimal, and I am now finished with college applications, so I doubt that will be too much of a problem.",AC,There is nothing in particular I think you should know about me or my impressions of the course so far.,NC
"The only concern I have is the difficulty with the course knowing that many people have said that it will be very hard. However, I feel like it'll be alright considering my performance in linear algebra.",AC,There is nothing individually that I would need. I very much like the course so far because of its similarity to the layout of the linear algebra course.,NC
I do not have any concerns at the moment.,NC,There is nothing so far.,NC
"Last year, I struggled a lot with true and false questions and concerned that I might repeat the same thing this semester.",AC,,NC
The tests being in MML makes them difficult to complete on mobile.,TC,NA,NC
I wish that every single question on the homework had a walk you through it or an example.,AC,N/A,NC
"I would like to focus on retaining the material better, since I find it harder to retain the information as well for online courses.",AC,N/A,NC
I'm a bit worried about the content and the difficulty.,AC,n/a,NC
"I'm a little concerned as to whether or not I will be able to understand many of the topics we learn about, but I'm also confident that I will put in my best.",AC,N/A,NC
I'm just a little intimidated by how much the exams and final are worth.,AC,N/A,NC
"I'm slightly concerned about preparing from exams, but I know that I can look at practice exams and MML practice to study and ensure that I understand the material.",AC,N/A,NC
"My biggest concern is keeping up with the deadlines especially because the GT breaks do not align with school breaks, so I will make sure to stay on schedule",AC,N/A,NC
"My concern is the extra exam we have compared to last semester. Last semester, there was two exams and the final, but with the extra exam, I am worried about how it will all work out.",AC,N/A,NC
My only concern is if it will add too much to my course load this semester.,PC,N/A,NC
"One concern I have about this course is that I forgot much of what I learned in calculus last year. However, I believe I will able to review the material that is necessary for this course and will regain the skills.",AC,N/A,NC
One concern or dislike I have is the canvas quizzes are taken away. These helped support my learning and understanding of the content much more.,AC,N/A,NC
"That it's been a while since I've done calculus. I personally feel it would have been better to have multivar first semester. Unless line alg is a prerequisite, then ignore this.",AC,N/A,NC
The one thing that concerns me the most is the fact that the in-person exams are worth 10% more than in Linear Algebra.,AC,N/A,NC
"The only thing that concerns me about this course is that my calculus foundation is not strong. I believe last semester, my strong algebra foundation helped me a lot in linear algebra but this semester I am concerned about how my weak calculus foundation will impact my learning pace.",AC,n/a,NC
"The only thing that worries me is that since this is mostly an online class, I might not get as much practice as I should in-person nsetting. Math requires a lot of practice; hence it is important that i get in sufficient practice before any of the assessments.",AC,n/a,NC
"The tests are 60% of our grade, we don't have quizzes anymore, and grades aren't dropped.",AC,N/A,NC
The thing that concerns me the most is having a smaller diversity of practice problems. I don't want to use the exam prep sheets before I begin studying for the exam but I would also like practice problems besides what is on MML. The extra credit webwork will hopefully cover this but it doesn't become available until the 22nd.,AC,N/A,NC
The weight of the exams worries me for getting a good grade.,AC,N/A,NC
"The workload, this is a college class so I will definitely have a lot more work here than in any of my other classes.",AC,N/A,NC
The increased complexity of the actual technical math work compared to linear algebra. I struggled occasionally in BC calculus so multivariable is daunting in comparison.,AC,"N/A, so far, the course feels alright but I will only really know about my impressions on its technical difficulty as we get farther in.",NC
"I feel like the 3 exams concern me since last semester we had 2. Also the final being worth 30% of the grade is a lot in my opinion, since I have never had a test weigh more.",AC,NA,NC
"I got a B last semester and I heard this class can be harder, so I知 worried about that.",AC,NA,NC
I think it's just the leap from weekly homeworks to mass studying a few days before exams.,AC,NA,NC
"I think my time management skills are the most concerning. Preparing well before a test, and studying consistently, I should manage my time well.",PC,NA,NC
I worry about falling behind in content.,AC,NA,NC
"I'm a bit worried about the in-person examinations as they will now take up 60% of our grade. Other than that, I am not too worried.",AC,NA,NC
"I'm afraid about the difficulty of this course, but that was also the same for last semester's. Calculus, especially series, was a struggle and I understand that I will do better if I put in more effort, but I still feel like I'm going to stress over learning.",AC,NA,NC
I'm concerned about the level of importance for the exams (being now 30%) and I'm also worried for the lack of quizzes (since those were helpful).,AC,NA,NC
"I'm concerned the course may move quickly and that I will have to review calculus, which I may have forgotten since last year.",AC,NA,NC
I'm concerned with my calculus knowledge. I took AB and BC last year and havent done much review since.,AC,NA,NC
I'm most concerned that I will not understand the material being taught and that I won't be able to execute my knowledge during the exams. I hope to mitigate this by consistently doing practice exams to prepare myself for the actual exam.,AC,NA,NC
I'm worried I might have forgotten some of the stuff that the course expects me to know.,AC,NA,NC
"In linear algebra, I got into a groove with my coursework. I feel like it is going to be a lot different with this course. It is a different kind of math, there are no quizzes, there are three exams, and the lecturer is different. My biggest concern is that the lady on the lecture videos does not do as great of a job as Dr. Mayer did with linear algebra.",AC,NA,NC
"My biggest concern is actually understanding the course content. So far, it seems a decent bit complicated, and I know it's only going to get harder.",AC,NA,NC
"I concerned about getting a B like last semester. Although I feel more confident in this course's material for reasons previously stated, I need to make sure I stay on task and adequately review material.",AC,N/A,NC
"I don't have a lot of concerns about this course, mainly just worrying about how well I'll learn the material.",AC,N/A,NC
I am slightly concerned for the lack of a practice exam.,AC,I am very excited to be back in a calculus class!,NC
I am concerned about the pace of the course and the difficulty of the concepts taught throughout the course.,AC,N/A,NC
I am nervous I will think I will understand the topic but ultimately fail the exams.,AC,N/A,NC
"I am concerned about the ""calculus"" portion as it relates to derivatives and integrals - although I was proficient in it, the concept can become quite complex.",AC,N/A,NC
* I'm concerned that I might have some difficulty learning online/not being able to ask questions as easily as I would be able to in a in-person class.,AC,N/A,NC
"As this course is going to mix linear algebra and calculus, I'm worried about the content. However, I plan to attend more studio sessions to fully understand this content.",AC,N/A,NC
"At this point in the semester, I am most concerned about studying for the exams, as I am worried that my current studying techniques will be ineffective given the amount of content involved in an exam, more specifically the final exam.",AC,N/A,NC
"At this point in the semester, true and false questions concern me the most in this course, as I do not do as well with conceptual questions. Luckily, Dr. Mayer mentioned that MATH 2551 is less theoretical so I am hoping it will be less difficult this semester.",AC,N/A,NC
I am a bit concerned about the difficulty of the course and the things I will need to do to manage my time with my other classes.,AC,N/A,NC
"I am most concerned about being able to learn online, because I struggled last semester and had to do a lot of group studying to understand some parts.",AC,N/A,NC
I am concerned about the lack of guidance from an in-person teacher. I often rely on asking the teacher questions to improve my understanding of certain concepts.,AC,NA,NC
I am concerned about the lack of quizzes. The quizzes in the linear algebra course helped me test my knowledge and I am not sure why this course does not have any.,AC,NA,NC
"I am concerned because I've heard that this is the hardest of all 4 distance math classes, so I'm scared that I won't understand something and won't do too well given that all exams combined are 60% of our grade.",AC,NA,NC
"I am concerned by the fast-moving pace of the course, but I believe with appropriate practice I will be able to gain a strong information of the content.",AC,NA,NC
I am concerned that I will not understand a concept and it will affect me for the rest of the course.,AC,NA,NC
I am concerned that I will struggle on exams with the lack of quizzes that I can retry like we could last semester. It showed me where to work more and promoted mastery of all subjects.,AC,NA,NC
"I am most concerned about getting behind on my work and getting stressed out, however that did not happen last semester so hopefully it doesn't this semester either.",PC,NA,NC
I am most concerned about not understanding the course and not doing well on exams.,AC,NA,NC
"I am most concerned with keeping up with the course. There is often much math to cover each week, so it is important that I manage my time well so that I am able to sufficiently understand and apply the material.",AC,NA,NC
I am worried about the exams being worth 60% of the grade this time and I want to make sure I spend an even longer time studying for the exams. I am concerned about making sure I fully learn all the content this semester because I feel like semester it was easy to get by without fully learning the content until the exams.,AC,NA,NC
"I am worried about the in person exams the most. In linear algebra I struggled to prepare well enough to see results despite studying, so I am worried that I will have the same struggles in this class.",AC,NA,NC
I am concerned about being able to recall things from Calculus quick enough to understand the new concepts in the course.,AC,NA,NC
I am concerned about how much practice I will have to do using resources outside of the work given by this course once the topics become more complex.,AC,NA,NC
"I am concerned about the exams because they have a much higher weight in this class, and the exams in linear algebra were hard for me. I am also concerned that I lost a lot of my knowledge of BC Calculus since it has been a while.",AC,NA,NC
Although I said I enjoy the incorporation of physics it also could be a challenge for me. I'm not the greatest at physics but it is just going to have to be part of the process and I'll take more time to understand how to use it in this class.,AC,NA,NC
"As the last time I had practiced calculus was 8+ months ago, I am a bit worried about my ability to remember the application of certain skills.",AC,NA,NC
"At this point, I'm not worried about the difficulty of the work, I'm worried about the timing of it since my spring semester looks like it will be busier than fall semester.",AC,NA,NC
Grades,AC,NA,NC
"I am a bit concerned that, unlike Linear Algebra, there are not quizzes due each week. Those quizzes not only helped to bolster my grade, but they were extremely useful to better understanding content. I will likely need to seek other sources for better understanding this semester.",AC,NA,NC
"I am concerned about not learning the content as deeply as I need to. Even after watching lecture videos and reading the textbook and doing the homework, there are still times where I struggle to keep up.",AC,NA,NC
I am concerned about taking another calculus class because I have forgotten just about all of the calculus I took previously.,AC,NA,NC
I am concerned about the fact that the in person exams count for so much grade-wise which means I don't have very much room for error on the exams.,AC,NA,NC
"I am concerned about the lack of quizzes. With linear algebra, I thought that the quizzes helped to reinforce understanding and acted as review material down the line",AC,NA,NC
I am most concerned about not understanding the material.,AC,NA,NC
"I heard some concepts are difficult to grasp, but otherwise no major concerns!",AC,NA,NC
"I tend to struggle with online courses and staying engaged so Im concerned about that. If I'm able to put in the time though, the material should be fairly easy for me.",AC,NA,NC
"I wasn't the best at Calc BC, and continuing calculus is a bit nervous for me, but I'm pretty confident with vectors and their related topics so I'm not too worried.",AC,NA,NC
"I'm mostly concerned about the difficulty- students generally have mixed opinions about the difficulty of Multivariable calculus as compared to Linear Algebra, so I hope that Multi isn't too much more challenging than LinAlg.",AC,NA,NC
"My concern now is that the exams hold a higher portion in the overall weight grade, but I believe with proper work and attention to learning that shouldn't be a problem. I'm also a bit worried because there are no quizzes each week, so I feel like I can't have that extra review I would normally have to learn. The part that concerns me the most is that we don't have module exams anymore which were helpful to me in the previous semester, but hopefully the kahoots can make up for that.",AC,NA,NC
"Not having enough practice without the weekly quizzes, having to learn harder content, greater amount of grade based on exams.",AC,NA,NC
"Not having weekly quizzes is a concern to me as they were helpful in gauging our knowledge for the exams last semester. Additionally, the percentage of Exam weight is a slight bit of a concern to me as last semester, I wasn't the best at exam-taking. Nonetheless, I will work this semester to be better.",AC,NA,NC
I am worried about having another exam. I did well on exams 1 and 2 during Linear Algebra but they always make me nervous.,AC,NA.,NC
"I'm concerned about not being able to attend the live lessons. Last semester I was able to watch recordings for the first quarter, but then I ended up stop watching the lessons altogether and just relied on the lesson videos and textbook.",PC,"NA. I'll ask a lot of questions, I guess.",NC
"I am a bit scared about how there are three exams this year instead of two like last year, but I know it will work out as long as I work hard.",AC,NA,NC
"I am also a little worried about the fact that there are fewer assignments, especially with there being no quizzes. This means there will be fewer practices and ""easy"" A's to affect our grades. I am also worried about the fact that there is another exam because exams are not my strong point in this course so this could drop my grade.",AC,No concerns,NC
"I am concerned about my ability to fully understand the subject material. Math does not come easy to me, especially math at this level. So I am also worried about the time I will have to dedicate to succees.",AC,None,NC
"Ensuring that I study ""enough"" before the first exam is my main concern, as I am still learning how much time I need to spend reviewing for collegiate level courses such as this one.",AC,None,NC
There are no quizzes every week. I like to use the quizzes for practice and as a checkpoint but now it'll be that much harder to study for the exams.,AC,Not that I can think of.,NC
I am most concerned about finishing learning and understanding the content before the exams roll around because there seems to be more content than last semester.,AC,The first B of my high school career was in Math 1554 so I hope that motivates me to push harder for an A this semester.,PC
"I am mostly concerned about being able to fully grasp the content, but that is mostly based on my own personal ability to learn and take the time to study for this course.",AC,"There is not really anything special concerning my needs except that my internet at home can sometimes stop working, but I will do my best to not let this issue affect my work in the course.",TC
Being able to pass the exam.,AC,,NC
I have no concerns yet.,NC,NA,NC

My biggest concern is not knowing all of the assignments or resources I need to utilize. It would be horrible if I found out I missed an assignment or an extra credit opprotunity.,AC,"I might not be able to attend live studio sessions because of after school hours, but I will try to watch all of the recordings.",PC
I just hope I can get a better grasp of concepts than I had last semester so that my grade can better reflect my capabilities.,AC,I struggled a lot last semester as there wasn't really peers I could turn towards for any sort of help as my school has very few people in this course and those people don't really help each other out.,AC

"It's been a while since I've done any calculus, so I might be rusty on some skills.",AC,I think multivariable calculus will be a more advanced form of calculus that I learned in AP.,AC
My main concern in striving for a A in this class.

Second, the course may require a significant amount of computational work and problem solving, which can be time-consuming and challenging.",AC,I'm very interested in physics and this class will definitely help pursue my passion in that field.,PC
My biggest concern is my ability to learn the material and pace myself. This semester will be more hectic than last semester making it more difficult to dedicate time to learning the material.,AC,I've learned a lot from the first segment of distance math in terms of what to expect with assignments and pacing so I'm not as worried about that this time around. One thing that I will be experiencing this semester is going to India for two weeks for a family event which may interfere with the course.,PC
"Something that concerns me is how everything builds in this unit. Like if I don't understand one unit, then it'll snowball into other units not ending up too well.",AC,"Math is somewhat of a struggle for me, but I'll try my best this semester!!",PC
I'm concerned with how it is based heavily on Calculus especially considering how difficult BC calculus was last year. I'm also scared that we will be expected to remember things from last year that I might not remember how to do. This course is also said to be covering more than Linear Algebra so it will go faster and I'm scared that I will get lost or confused or that it might go too fast for me. I think the breakdown of the Linear Algebra course really helped me so I am going to try to follow and trust the breakdown of this course as well.,AC,"My impression of the course so far is pretty good. I've heard that it is less theoretical and thus less complicated than the linear algebra course. I am looking forward to solving more porblems instead of memorizing rules and definitions. I am a little overwhlemed by the amount of content we will cover but I believe that as we go through it, I'll be alright with the piece by piece.",AC

I am also concerned about retaining all of the information for subsequent courses.",AC,I am very excited to see how linear algebra and multi build on each other and our understanding of mathematics. I am a little worried about taking the exams on different days but I have been talking to my facilitator and you.,AC
"I am concerned about falling behind the daily videos, as I struggled with this towards the end of last semester in Linear Algebra.",AC,"I believe that this course will be really fun/enjoyable, or at least more so than linear algebra as that was more conceptual and I enjoy being able to visualize the math functions",NC
"From my experience last semester, I felt very unprepared for the final and did not receive the grade that I wanted. Besides that, this course seems reasonable so far.",AC,I have heard alot about MVC from prior friends who have already taken this course and it seems like a very interesting course. I was very proficient at calculus and want to learn more about the subject as a whole considering more variables.,AC
"I am concerned about balancing the work needed for this course with other classes and extracurriculars. I have also heard that this course is more difficult than linear algebra, which worries me somewhat.",AC,I look forward to completing this course and learning about multivariable calculus.,NC
I am concerned about understanding the topic and receiving an A.,AC,I may need some assistance at some point or will have questions later in the course.,PC
"I am concerned with my ability to master the material on my own. I feel I can do well on the quizzes, but I feel less confident on the true and false questions. I sometimes have trouble with the theoretical questions.",AC,I really appreciate it when extra practice is posted for review before tests and exams.,AC
I have no concerns about this course.,NC,Everything so far has been quite simple. I have no individual needs towards the course.,AC

"I am a bit worried because due to my work, I miss many of the studio sessions and while I ant to complete the worksheets and watch the videos, I have trouble effectively checking my work. A centralized location with all of the studio worksheet answers would be very useful especially when I redo the worksheets to prepare for the final exam.",OT,I'm excited to start!,NC
"I have heard that MVC has a heavier workload than Linear Algebra. If this is true, I hope to manage my time wisely to get everything done in a punctual manner,",PC,"I am really excited to delve into this course. AP Calculus AB/BC has been my favorite high school class thus far, and I am looking forward to exploring the different concepts that MVC will expand on this semester.",AC
"In the end of my senior year of high school, balancing the rigor of this course with all of the other assignments I have due in my other classes, studying for AP tests, and getting ready for college will make this class challenging for me, but I am excited to take the class on as long as I maintain good, healthy study strategies.",PC,I believe all that would come up is just coordinating when to take exams with the other students at my school taking this class. I remember one of the exams had to be administered to my school a few days after it was to most other students. Organizing exam dates will be something I will need to be proactive about.,TC
I'm concerned about falling behind on assignments and not being able to catch up.,PC,"I often can't get notifications for my GT email to work, so I may miss some things.",TC
I worry about my procrastination habits.,PC,I think I will need additional resources regarding word problems and conceptual work because that was my weakest area in Linear Algebra.,AC
Keeping up with weekly work and avoiding procrastination.,PC,I think linear algebra has served as a good prerequisite to multivariable calc due to its applications in this spring course.,AC
I am a little concerned about falling behind the schedule and then having to rush to learn the concepts. I will try to maintain a consistent work session to ensure I perform my best however.,PC,I am enjoying the course so far and believe that if I need any help that I can access it easily through studio sessions and Piazza.,AC
"I think I am concerned about understanding the content and managing my time. I want to be able to fully understand each of the lessons, but I'm scared that I might not be able to. I'm also worried about finding the time to watch all the lessons and do adequate practice for each of them.",PC,I don't think there's anything that I need from you specifically. I think I just have to learn to manage my time and get my assignments done to be successful in this class.,PC
"I am concerned that I will get sidetracked by other things such as my IB exams and not give this course the attention it needs. However, I am currently preparing to make sure that does not happen.",PC,I love the class!,NC
Right now Iてve been sick with a fever since Friday last week so my main concern is not starting the semester already behind on work due to my illness.,PC,NA,NC
Not having a textbook to reference practice,AC,Hopefully it is less memorization than linear algebra,AC
"I'm still trying to see the TEAMS channel, but other than that, maybe that I need to refresh some of the Calculus skills and angle identities...",AC,NA,NC
I'm most concerned about the fact that our exams are 60% of our grade. This feels like a lot of pressure to put on a few tests.,AC,NA,NC
"I wasn't the biggest fan of AP Physics I (it was very difficult for me and I couldn't understand the concepts) and from the videos I've seen so far, this course reminds me of physics. When I took physics I was a sophomore and I'm a senior now who understands more math, but I'm still a little scared that I won't understand some stuff.

I'm also worried this course will be harder than linear algebra.",AC,NA,NC
Time management throughout this course.,PC,NA,NC
"Time management is my biggest concern, as well as stress. I'm hoping that I'm able to grasp the concepts in a timely manner, since geometric interpretation and thinking in 3 dimensions wasn't my strongest suit in previous years. I also hope I don't become overwhelmed with work and studying for this class.",PC,NA,NC
Time management,PC,NA,NC
The thing that most concerns me is the exam dates and shaping various extracurriculars around them.,AC,NA,NC
"The only thing that concerns me is the online nature of the course, which might make it harder for me to keep up with things because I won't be reminded of this class as much as I'm used to for other classes. Hopefully making a calendar will help.ｬ",AC,NA,NC

My only concern is hoping to pace myself and not get behind on work since it's online.,PC,NA,NC
"My nerves and staying on task. I feel like I understand the material but I let my nerves get the best of me which impacts how I do on my exams. Furthermore, sometimes my weeks are really busy and I don't get time to work on the assignments and have to rush them. I want to space out my time better.ｬ",PC,NA,NC
"My main concern with taking this course is time management, as it is self-paced, but because all of the lecture videos are available, I believe this will not be a large problem.",PC,N/A,NC
"My main concern is the amount of time I will have to dedicate to this course as I will be more busy this year, so I will have to work to utilize my time more efficiently.",PC,"My impression of the course if very positive and gives me a good impression of the college experience overall, as it is much more structured than I anticipated.",NC
My main concern is meeting all deadlines and not being overwhelmed by the work. I feel like I can achieve this by working ahead at the start to give myself a buffer and avoid falling behind.,PC,N/A,NC
My main concern is keeping motivation for the course and keeping myself on track so I don't have too much last minute work.,PC,NA,NC

I want to make sure I am on top of deadlines. I need to ensure that I sync my Canvas calendar with my google calendar.,PC,Looking forward to learning from you Dr. Mayer. Appreciate all of your support this semester and last.,NC
"I think my biggest concern is time management. Last semester, I did a really terrible job of managing my time because I was busy with college applications and other things. It was easy for me to forget about this class sometimes because of its asynchronous nature. I am really, really, really making sure that I manage my time well enough so that I can dedicate enough time to this class to not only pass but to really engage with the content (if that makes sense).",PC,"I think this is going to be a really fun class! I loved calculus last year, so I am excited to learn more.

"I feel like it moves really fast. I don't know if I am just building it up in my head and maybe this is the same speed things normally are, but things just appear to go very fast. It is a pretty big complicated subject so I get it, but it just concerns me. I want to be able to keep up.",PC,NA,NC
I am worried about getting overworked with my extraciricular schedule combined with GT Math.,PC,NA,NC
I am the most concerned about staying ahead of the material so that I am not rushed when completing any of the assignments.,PC,"I really like the extra practice that we receive sometimes, so if there are any opportunities like with the webwork or other assignments to do more problems and gain instant feedback, I would love to hear about and complete them.",AC
I am concerned about my pace. I hope to be a week ahead by spring break.,PC,None,NC
"Honestly, the anticipated course workload this spring semester concerns me the most. Since I am taking this course in addition to my high school AP courses, I am worried that the workload in this course might get heavy, especially in the middle of the semester, while my workload in my other classes intensifies as well. I'm worried about having to grind out more work and get everything done in due time.ｬ",PC,NA,NC

What concerns me most is I won't understand the concepts well enough.,AC,I currently have no individual needs or impressions of the course.ｬ,NC
Understanding all of the material and preparing enough about the exams.,AC,NA,NC
"Ultimately, my biggest concern is grading. Dr. Mayer mentioned in the welcome video that this course would be moving at a faster pace than the last semester of Distance Math (Linear Algebra NC554) and I was only able to make an average B in that course. I do not think I am at risk of making a lower grade in this course, but it would be good to bring my grade up to an A (especially given my plans to secure the Hope Scholarship and gain a secure understanding of this material for further courses that require it.)",AC,N/A,NC

The main thing that concerns me is that I will put things off like I did last semester.,PC,NA,NC
"The first unit seems to have a number of physics related aspects, which was a class I struggled in more than most.",AC,NA,NC
The Final Exam,AC,NA,NC
The exams since in linear algebra the practice exams didn't help with the final exam and I was forced to remember all the content that I had studied outside of the practice exams.ｬ,AC,NA,NC
The exams and the true false questions. I'm definitely going to lock in extra hard conceptually i order to prepare for those.,AC,NA,NC

One of my concerns includes balancing this rigorous class with other classes at my school and extracurriculars.ｬ,PC,NA,NC
One concern I have about this course is my ability to fully learn and comprehend all the material through an online format. This is my first online class and adjusting to this online class was difficult for me the first semester.,PC,NA,NC
not having enough additional resources,AC,NA,NC
NA - I was initially worried about losing motivation but that has disappeared as my friends and I hold each other accountable.,NC,NA,NC
"My only concern is prior knowledge needed for this course, as I need to touch up on any important Calculus concepts, but it can easily be addressed by just reviewing.",PC,N/A,NC
My one concern is this course conflicting with CS NC33NC as both classes are difficult and time-consuming and have their exams on the same days.,PC,N/A,NC
My most pressing concern is similar to last semester which is that I am unsure as to whether I will fall behind or have any confusing questions that will remain unanswered.,PC,"I am able to do all of the work that I need to do, but I might struggle with certain concepts and have to do personal research to find the answers I am looking for.ｬ",PC

My biggest concern is not being prepared enough with True/False questions and Impossible/Possible questions that are on the exams.,AC,NA,NC
Multivariable calculus is hard,PC,NA,NC
"Much of the material in the previous course was oftentimes hard to understand because it seemed like many formulas were pulled out of thin air. For me, that makes it extremely hard to understand what is going on.ｬ",AC,"I would like some linked resources/videos or anything that takes me logically through a proof of many of the identities and formulas mentioned in the class.

"It would probably be memorizing my material for the exams, since those are not open note.",PC,N/A,NC
"In high school calculus, we only worked with minimal variables which made graphs easy to visualize. However, the only worry I have with the class is the ability to visualize the multivariable functions, as well as extend the ideas of differentiation and integration to multiple dimensions.",PC,"I must admit, linear algebra has been quite a journey for me. The abstract concepts and the depth of the material made it challenging, but I embraced the struggle and managed to grasp most of it. Now, as we delve into multivariable calculus, I can't help but feel a bit anxious. However, I hope to learn the most out of your teachings and look forward to the class.",PC
I'm worried about my comprehension of the material.,PC,N/A,NC

I looked ahead to some of the later concepts, like triple integrals, and I'm concerned I won't be able to understand them.",PC,"The course seems pretty hard and involved, and I'm worried I won't have enough practice, which I benefit from immensely, for assessments. Practice is often the way where I internalize concepts and ideas.",PC
I'm not sure how much Calc BC I still remember after doing Linear Algebra last semester. It may take me some effort to remember calculus concepts.,PC,I enjoy the course and I think that it has the right balance of challenging and interesting while not overwhelming.,NC
"I'm not really sure what concerns I have; I'm taking a course at my school right now and I sometimes just struggle with understanding Lagrange multipliers and some topics, but hopefully everything will be explained in depth.",PC,N/A,NC

I'm a little worried about multivariable calculus in general and understanding the concepts. It also seems as if there will be a lot more formulas in this class as compared to linear algebra so I'll really have to work on memorizing all of them.,PC,N/A,NC
I'm a little nervous because I'm not sure if I remember everything from my Calculus BC class from last year. So I might need to do some individual review to make sure I am ready for the new content that builds off of what I learned last year.,PC,I would like to know about the connection between this class to my last calculus class and what are the most important topics to review that we will build off of the most.,AC

However, I am willing to commit because it is an investment into my future not only in my intend area of study but also in my daily life. While I may not be applying these concepts daily, I believe that the thinking process that I must go through each time I solve a math problem will help me with critical thinking, something I must apply daily.

"I hope that I will be able to stay on track of work and manage my time. I also hope that the quizzes and HW will help prepare me for the proctored exam. For example, even though those are open note, I hope by the time I get to the exam, I won't need the notes.",AC,"For right now, I think the course can be a bit challenging since you have to understand and know concepts rather than applying the same algorithm to each question. It's a good level of challenging, and it tests my ability to keep a schedule myself.

My schedule during the fall is also a challenge for me. I wish I could attend live studio lessons, but I have band practice on those hours. Watching recordings are very helpful though.",AC

"Although there are plenty of resources to be successful in MATH 1554 through canvas, piazza, studios, and the textbook, ideally, the lectures and lessons would be most effective in a face to face setting.",AC,"So far, the course content has been challenging, but mamageable at the same time. Because there are a lot of resources to study and review, it makes it easy to go back and get extra practice on stuff that I'm struggling on. So even though I find the course material hard, I know exactly what to do to get better.",NC
"I have no concerns so far, as the textbook and videos are quite easy to understand.",NC,"I really enjoy the material so far. I did not expect it to be mostly conceptual, however, it is not a problem.",NC
"I'm mostly concerned about the formatting of the answers on online tests and how that can affect the results that I get on a test if I got the question correct. For example, if the answer was a fraction such as 2/3 and I type that in and get it incorrectly, then I would be worried about how that would affect the grade that I would receive on an assignment.",AC,"There is not much information about my individual needs or impressions of the course, but I do think that the MyLab mastering book is a little difficult to navigate especially when trying to access the textbook. Rather than that, the MyLab and Mastering homework was useful for me to understand how to do certain problems more in depth.",TC
"I am concerned about getting answers to questions that I might have, but it should not be a problem due to access to Piazza and similar resources that will allow me to discuss and investigate my questions.",AC,"So far the course is somewhat difficult, but it seems like I will make a strong enough connection that makes it easier for me to understand the applications of this course, so that the math does not seem as abstract as it currently does.",AC

There are none.,NC,There isn't anything.,NC
It's been fine for me so far. The videos have been helping a lot. The other students in my school who take the same course as me have been a great help in both my motivation and understanding of the course.,NC,"The course definitely seems a lot more abstract than the other courses I've taken and I feel like I'm a lot more on my own than in a regular high school class. However, I've taken online courses like this before and I feel like I'm doing ok so far. I'm not digesting a lot of the information at first, but I do get more comfortable with the material as I approach the homework.",AC

I am worried that I might accidentally miss an assignment due to lack of awareness on where content is posted.,TC,I think the course is very interesting that uses a different approach to math!,NC
I don't have any concerns.,NC,So far I think the course has been easy to follow and easy to understand. I think the TA's and the prerecorded videos have been very helpful in understanding the material because of all the practice problems they help with and the extra information they cover.,NC
"I initially feared that communication with the instructor would be difficult, so any questions I may have about this rigorous course may go unanswered. After getting used to the course, I realized that the modules were quite thorough in explaining the content and that there were several ways to not only contact the instructor, but my peers as well.",AC,"I was initially really fearful about the course due to it being a college math class and being a part of college GPA, but after getting used to it I am starting to remember how much I enjoy math, and I understand the course content so far, which makes me comfortable and confident. This course is one where I genuinely want to go through the assignments and I look forward to learning more about linear algebra.",AC
Mainly getting enough practice,AC,,NC
None. I have done well in virtual classes previously so I am prepared to work hard and excel in this class.,NC,"Nothing much, other than that I'm excited to learn the material.",NC
My biggest concern is just making sure I stay on top of the class and not get behind.,AC,"So far I like the course, but I think the thing I struggle with most are true or false and concept questions, so more practice with those would be great.",AC
"My main concern is that I am not learning as well, since it is hard to have collaborative learning when you are at home.",AC,"The course seems pretty tough, but I think I will be able to manage. I'm still a little confused as to the application of all this, and why we describe linear equations in ways like consistency, uniqueness, dependency, etc. I'm trying to understand what the real-world interpretations of all these descriptors would be.",PC
Learning without active instructional time for questions and proofs and just better engagement will be difficult for me. I?m hoping office hours and studio sessions will help with that.,AC,"So far, it seems relatively simple as it builds off of algebra 2 more than I expected. Im excited to drive into more interesting theorems and applicable math.",NC
"The material in this course is quite new and unfamiliar to me, so my main concern is with mastering the content without the assistance of a physical teacher and an in-person class. The work requires lots of reading and time commitment in order to review the textbook material and the video lectures, which is something I am mindful of as I manage my time.",AC,"The course at first seems a little daunting without a physical teacher being present, and that this course is unlike any other math course I have taken before. There are a lot of theorems and concepts to know, and I feel that it will get easier with a little bit of practice. I love that the professors, TAs, and students are doing as much as possible to build a sense of community though this is a remote course.",NC
None for now.,NC,Not for now,NC
"My concerns lie primarily in the realm of seeking help when I encounter any difficulties with course content. As I play varsity volleyball at my school, I am unable to attend the majority of studio sessions and office hours but seek to find a way by which I can effectively receive assistance from course assistants and the professor.",AC,"I am enjoying the course thus far! However, as I go through the material, I realize it isn't as intuitive for me as it may be for others and feel that sometimes I have gaps in my understanding of the material. I hope to overcome this barrier through continued practice in the MyMathLab textbook.",AC
None!,NC,"I am loving Linear Algebra! It's challenging, fast-paced, and really makes me think, which is what I love the most. I think the most difficult part content-wise is the theoretical aspect of the course, which I hope to get a better grasp of through practice.",NC

Is this course going to remain remote using Canvas throughout the year (including Multivariable Calc next semester)?,AC,"All of the answers I chose for the first question- ""Which of the following technologies can you easily access at school?"" were items that I have access to at home as that is where I take this course (off-campus).

The course seems to be easy so far; however, the topics are getting just a little more complicated. Watching the lectures definitely helps though.",AC
"I was a bit worried about the pacing of the course and how I would stay organized, but the syllabus alleviated those worries.",NC,"I have really enjoyed the course these past few weeks, but I feel the lecture videos may be too quick to fully understand the concepts: perhaps extension videos could be useful.",AC

Keeping on pace without falling behind; actually grasping the material without an in-person teacher; the fatigue of taking this class at the end of the day after other classes,AC,This is super interesting material and I'm excited! I'm just also really exhausted from my other classes and work so it can be challenging for me to keep focus.,PC
"Some of the course content seems pretty challenging to understand, and some practice questions are worded difficultly, plus having to take the course online individually is less involving and engaging than an actual classroom.",AC,"The course is challenging, but should be manageable to some degree. There's a lot of conceptual math to learn with less calculation-based material. Also, this course's true/false questions are almost always the most daunting questions.",AC
"My only concern for taking this class remotely is that I move at a pace too quickly to fully comprehend the material. In a regular class, schedules are formulated to avoid this.",AC,"My impressions of the course so far is that it is very well made.

Many of the opportunities to meet with TAs through office hours alleviates some of my fear regarding that.",AC,"By the end of week two, I am enjoying this class quite a bit. I absolutely love math so this makes me feel in my element. I also really am appreciative that all quizzes and tests have infinite attempts. It means I do not have to be anxious about my grade, and I can simply focus on learning!",NC
"I am concerned about not having enough practice in terms of worksheets that build up (from simple problems to more complex), especially for proctored exams. I am spending most of my time taking notes and doing the assigned work, barely doing additional problems due to lack of time. Furthermore, I am nervous about proctored exams because I feel unprepared for them.",AC,"It is difficult for me to make studio times, but I try my best to watch them later in the week. At first, it was difficult managing the additional work since school already started before, but after some time, I believe I am more on track. I just want to make sure I can do everything possible to have solid understandings for exams.",AC
"One thing I am concerned about is communication with the instructors, but with the help of the studio sessions and the piazza platform, I don't think this will become an issue.",TC,"I like that all the resources are available so I can use what I need personally to succeed in the course.

The only concern would be technical issues that would be out of my control.,TC,I like your videos and handwriting.,NC
none,NC,The course is conceptually challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material that is being taught. I often need to watch the lecture videos more than once to truly grasp what I am learning.,AC
"Just some things about immediate help, but it looks like Piazza and studio sessions will be helpful with that.",NC,Nothing in particular.,NC
My main concern about taking this class remotely is not having enough practice readily available to me so that I can practice key concepts to strengthen my understanding of the topic.,AC,"Currently, the content of the course seems harder to comprehend than any other class I have previously taken and some of the problems seen in the homework/module quizzes are more difficult to understand, but very forgiving and allows for major improvement.",NC

"My biggest concern is that I will not fully grasp certain concepts if I do not learn them in person. It is only me and one other person taking this course in my county, so we do not have a big group to help each other. I know that we have Piazza which should help, but it still is not the same as learning and understanding the content in person.",AC,"So far, the course has gone better than expected. I will admit that I was scared going into it, but the Canvas site is pretty easy to navigate and learn with. That really helps ease my nerves about this class.",NC

I am also concerned about my ability to keep track of every deadline mentioned in the syllabus.",PC,"I feel that this course is a lot more conceptual and requires a deeper understanding than any previous math course. Past math courses allowed for algorithmic solutions to problems, but the ""true/false"" questions regarding the concepts in this course needs the student to have a great understanding of the content to be successful.",NC
none,NC,This is a great setup!,NC
Remote learning is not a big issue for me. Only disadvantage is the lack of actual face to face discussion and interaction.,AC,The course for the most part has taught me things I have never seen before.

Once I understand a concept mentally, I am able to apply it. Oftentimes, however, I don't understand what I'm doing, but I'll get it right which isn't helpful in the long run, for comprehension, and/or for tests.

I am slightly worried about being prepared for exams because compared to assignments it seems much more restrictive; assignments and exams seem to be very different in approach and I worry that these differences in approach could be problematic on an exam. I specifically mention writing out problems in an organized manner and solving them within time limits. To a lesser degree I also worry about staying on top of the class but I have been good about that thus far.,AC,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the textbook for the class thus far and I think it presents the material in a very clear manner with useful examples. I also really like the way the course is structured; the ability to do assignments at your own pace and being able to check answers/consult resources is very nice and makes the process less stressful. Being able to attempt as many times as necessary and with no time constraint is great because it lets you focus only getting the question right and understanding it. Written assignments also seem helpful as they address one of my concerns earlier with the tests; I am hoping that the feedback and practice will prepare me for how to format things on exams.

I am worried about making sure that I understand the concepts without having a teacher in the same room as me to explain and answer questions.,AC,"I like how organized the course has been so far, and the structured format of the weekly videos and assignments is very helpful for me. I also really like the studio sessions because they help me gain a better understanding of topics.",NC
"I'm worried about the learning experiences, as I usually excel more in in-person than online classes. I feel a disconnect between the teachers and myself, and I think that hinders my performance. I have loved every single math course I have taken and often did well, but this course is more rigorous and challenging, with it being remote on top of that. I hope we can receive the same direct attention.",AC,"My impressions of this course so far are that it is very difficult and the concepts are very complex when understanding them at first.

"Some concerns I have from taking this course virtually is not being able to fully understand topics from a non-traditional teaching way. The last time I took a math course virtually was during my Covid-19 year and it was difficult to learn and I had to put extra effort in, but I am willing to do that through practice and guidance. From viewing the course syllabus and videos, I am already assured that there is a great support system in place and in my 9th grade year I wasn't sure I had that and felt stressed learning all the math on my own.",AC,Math has always been my favorite subject and I'm excited to learn more through this course.,NC
The lack of further explanation from the professor when confused and having to rely on peers to collectively understand the material to the full extent.,AC,"I feel as though there needs to be greater explanation of each topic, specifically definitions. For example, linear independence and dependence I feel should have a visual that helps describe whatIS and what itMEANS to be linearly independent/dependent. Otherwise, I am blindly trying to memorize the differences without anyway to truly connect them all together. Overall, I think there is a lack of connection between each lesson that really helps elaborate the goal that linear algebra is trying to accomplish.",AC

Not being able to solve doubts and questions as easily as an offline class.,AC,Not particularly.,NC
"What concerns me about taking this class remotely is juggling it around with my other classes at school in which I would need to find better ways to study and work smarter, but not harder that will take all of my time away from doing classwork from other classes.",AC,"I think the course is great, I did just realized about where I take notes on in which was from the modules which did mess me up on the 1st assignment, but everything else is doing well. The modules are presented to the degree where almost everyone having different beginnings in regards to approaching this course, to where despite on my 1st assignment not getting a hundred (on my part), I'm glad that I got a 98.8 because of the modules that I find it easier to understand and learn.",NC
My concerns are being able to set time aside to obtain virtual help with any content that I was not able to understand through the videos or through the textbook. The reason why it is difficult to set time aside is because I am very busy with my regular school work.,AC,"If students were to be limited on time, is it best for students to spend their time viewing the lecture videos or reading the textbook pages?",AC

I do not have any concerns about taking this class remotely.,AC,My impressions of the course so far are that this is a highly conceptual class where there is a lot of vocabulary for me to understand.,NC
"I don't hold many concerns except for the number of websites I might have to switch around and checking my email often as I already have multiple emails for college and school. As long as I stay diligent, it should be fine.",PC,"Course is a struggle I'll say that much.. it's taking time to understand the concepts, so I'll need to put some more in before exam days. It's tough to say the least; things like span and the parallel parameters get confusing conceptually.",AC

"I initially thought it would be hard to learn without face to face instruction, but the videos and learning sessions are super helpful. I am now just concerned if I will spend enough time practicing.",AC,n/a,NC
A couple of concerns I have about being remote are not having enough time to learn everything and going through complications when I am looking for help.,AC,"I am part of a number of extracurriculars including varsity volleyball, which practices 2 hours a day, 3 days a week. Games are 2 days a week and typically last from 4-8. Therefore, time will be a large constraint on me until mid-October. I am under the impression that this course is very rigorous and I will try my best to submit all my assignments on time, though I am somewhat nervous because of my packed schedule.",PC
"I don't think myself as a great self-study learner, and I prefer being in class with a teacher that can readily respond to questions on the spot. Office hours certainly do help, but the immediate feedback is what helps me learn best. Also, the videos are really nice because I was more used to self-studying based on textbooks, so the Dr. Mayer talk through is extremely helpful.",AC,"Not really, but I do like the pacing of the course and the videos are very clearly explained. I like how Dr. Mayer goes through examples at the end of each lesson because examples are perhaps one of the best things that consolidates information and builds intuition.",NC
My main concern is if I have something come up or I have a question that does not get answered by the time an assignment is due and I lose points if I turn in the assignment late.,AC,Not in particular. I just want to learn more about the uses of a matrix.,AC

"I don't necessarily have any concerns with taking this class remotely, I will do my best to stay on pace with the work and succeed in the course.",NC,"No, I'm excited to be taking this course :)",NC
"My main concern is getting completely lost and being unable to figure things out, even with support from fellow students and instructors online. I am not the biggest fan of online learning. I prefer learning in person more, but I am capable of learning by myself digitally. I am glad that I have my friends in person to support and help me whenever I am confused.

Other concerns for this class are just being able to manage time well and understanding everything in an excellent manner. Time management is something we have to work on, but I am scared that as the class progresses, the course material will become too difficult to the point where I won't be able to move on since I will not understand things completely.

These are my biggest concerns.",PC,"My first impression of the course was that it was a bit unorganized at the start. We were given so much to consider and look at from the beginning, and I was overwhelmed very quickly. However, as it is only the 2nd week, I feel that I am starting to get the hang of things.

Regarding my individual needs, I think I learn better with more explanations and frequent concept reminders. This is probably done well in the studio sessions. Unfortunately, due to how my morning class schedule and afternoon schedule are arranged, I have been unable to attend one.",AC
"None of the studio session hours fit my schedule. Other than that, nothing.",PC,"I like the course; the lecture videos are well paced. The homework does feel like it takes a while to complete, but I think that is good because it helps nail in some of the concepts better.",NC

Sometimes I will fall behind and need to catch up quickly as I am not attending a class daily.,AC,None,NC
I do not have any concerns at this time.,NC,I have no comments at this time.,NC
Falling behind because I don't have a class that I attend frequently in person,AC,This course seems like it requires a lot of practice to learn all the material properly.,AC
"I learn best when collaborating with other students, for example, hearing concepts in the words of kids my age, and trying to explain concepts different ways to other students, and working problems as a collective. Although I have a solid group at school of kids taking this class, I am a little nervous since I do most of my work for this class alone. However I feel like training myself to learn more independently will be a very useful skill for college, and I'm looking forward to the challenge.



Also, my school blocks canvas and pearson on its wifi! I have wifi at home thankfully so this shouldn't be too much of an issue, but I'm used to doing work from other classes during downtime in my school day which I have a lot of, so not being able to do work for this class at school is mildly frustrating.",PC,"I've never taken a math course online, or one that is as conceptual as I've been told this class is, so I'm not really sure what kind of support I need in the moment. However, I will probably try and sit in on office hours somewhat regularly because typically in my math courses, hearing concepts explained numerous times helps solidify material in my head.",AC
"If any, I am concerned about learning the content remotely. However, I think I will be fine as long as do practice and stay on track.",AC,None,NC
"Collaborating with other students often helps me better understand the material, so I am slightly concerned that an online platform can't quite replicate that. While there are platforms to communicate with others it doesn't quite match the benefits of face-to-face collaboration.",AC,"There is nothing I can think of that I need individually. So far, the course has been going pretty well, but it is definitely an adjustment switching to a completely online platform.",NC

I'm not too concerned with much. I'm only worried that I may not understand the material as thoroughly due to the nature of this course.,AC,"There's not much, though I think this course is pretty interesting so far.",NC
I am concerned that I may not always be able to get as much help as I may need. I enjoy interacting and asking questions in-person more than on a video conferencing platform or on an online forum as the feedback is instant and I can easily work on the problem in front of the person I am asking the question to.,AC,"I feel this course will be more difficult than Calculus BC last year as I do not have previous knowledge about the content. Additionally, I struggling a lot with asynchronous learning during Covid, but hopefully I will do better this time around as I have in-person classmates that can help me clarify confusing topics. As of what I've experienced so far, it is definitely a challenging course.",AC
"One of my primary fears is that I am going to fall behind or that not having a specific class time will make accomplishing assignments at home more difficult. So far I have found that doing all my notes, textbook readings, and lecture videos at home has made it harder for me to distinguish my ""class/lecture"" time from my homework time. That aspect has made it a little difficult for me to pick up the information and remember subjects well because I feel like every day I have picked up new material but haven't given myself the time to work with the other stuff and practice it. However, I think throughout the course this issue will be resolved as I get into a rhythm and establish a routine.

On another note, I am also afraid of exams and being fully prepared for those.",AC,"I ask a lot of questions. I get really anxious and nervous about a lot of stuff, and asking questions is a good opportunity for me to confirm information and calm myself. I know it is pretty standard for students to ask questions, but I just felt obligated to let you know since it might be a little more than average. Anyway, I'm just going to need that time and space to ask questions in order for me to be comfortable with this course and the material. (However, this course seems to provide a lot of opportunities to ask questions and reach out, so I am excited about that! You and your team are doing an excellent job in that department!)",PC
no concerns :),NC,"Not really. I think the coursework is fair, and the material is easy to learn if you pay attention to the videos.",NC
"I am worried about not understanding the content and needing to seek help because this is my first time experiencing a digital environment without a teacher. However, I take this class with my peers, so if I do need any help, my peers would be able to assist me!",AC,I believe that I will likely ask questions or do extra practice to prepare me for the upcoming exams. I plan on doing some of the textbook practice questions at the end of some textbook sections. I believe that this course is very well-designed and easy to understand for people who choose to learn digitally.,AC
I don't,NC,"First just wanted to say I love this course and the topic. Also, I am duel enrolled(my high school is homeschool) through Gatech for math and KSU for other classes, so I don't have to worry about having to coordinate the class time with the ""high school""",NC

This would make some of the additional practice material not available - for example the YouTube channel that the T.A. has mentioned during the Studio classes.

,NC,"Honestly the videos are a little confusing at times. I think it is because when explaining things, formal definitions are used rather than explaining the actual concept. Also there aren't very many examples (usually only one), and they aren't explained thoroughly enough when there are (ex: steps are skipped, assumptions are made about what we already know).

For the first week, going from the videos to the Canvas quiz and MML was very confusing because the videos did not give exposure to the types of questions in those assignments-- we had to figure it out on our own either by looking at the example problem on Math Lab, asking a friend, or by watching supplemental videos.

Formal definitions are not bad, but there should be simplified versions as well to help us understand.
