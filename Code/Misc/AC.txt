My biggest concern is remembering to do this course work since it feels distant from the rest of my high school work.', 'I am concerned primarily with asking questions, because I am generally used to asking teachers questions during lectures to confirm points before continuing.\xa0', 'Before starting, I was concerned about finding other students to discuss and work with, and to ask and answer questions?but Piazza and Discord have solved that rather quickly.', 'The absence of questions and answers for assignments, seminars, etc. is my main worry.', 'I am hoping to access additional homework or practice questions beyond what is currently available. The questions in the MML, and particularly the practice quiz, appear to be more challenging than the examples provided during lectures. This is worrisome as I do not want to face difficulties and get stuck during the test, which carries weight in my grade, as these questions might require significant analytical and problem-solving skills like what I have seen.', 'Increased workload/curriculum', 'The currentness of the content and how comparable the content of the practice is to the actual tests.\xa0', 'A lesser ability to inquire about certain things that the lectures or textbook do not clarify, and therefore the need to look up other resources (such as YouTube videos) to potentially find such clarification. However, this is largely mitigated by the existence of Piazza and the Discord server.', "I am enjoying the course so far, but I think it would be even more interesting if there were optional, extra readings/videos that go more into depth about certain concepts or real-world applications that we can't cover in the course itself. These wouldn't have to be over 5 minutes, and they would introduce the student to new things so that the student can then independently explore such things further.", 'I think that this course will be harder especially because it is online.\xa0', 'Just not being able to understand a concept because it is more difficult to communicate ideas online through videos\xa0', 'I worry about the differences between the in-person exams and the homework.', "So far the workload hasn't been too easy or too hard, but I worry about all of the theorems I'll have to know about.", "I am a person that asks a lot of questions, especially when it comes to math, because I really want to understand the content. I really appreciate the various methods of asking questions in this course, but I feel like I have so many content questions already that I don't know where to start.\xa0", "I swim competitively so I have to miss decent amounts of school for meets as well as things like official visits. For the visits I should be able to keep up fine but I can't get any work done during meets. My specific concerns during meets are the tests and exams but I should be able to work everything out with my exam proctor (I think).", 'Mostly just making sure that I am properly learning all of the material from the course since this is the first course that I am taking online.', 'My concerns are getting work done on time and staying organized.\xa0', 'None. I have a group of students taking the course with me, so we ask each other questions and solve questions together when struggling.', "I'm worried about forgetting about a due date.", "It's a lot less stressful that it seems at first!", 'Getting behind, hard to stay accountable', 'My only concern would be the process of learning the modules through videos, instead of seeing it done in front of me.', 'I have noticed a little bit of skipping steps in the lecture videos so far, and sometimes get confused with how we got from one step to another.', "I have a little concern about the self-teaching aspect that comes with any class that is done remotely, but I think I'll be able to handle it.", 'My only concern is not being able to ask questions in real-time, but I know there are many opportunities to get help if I need it.\xa0', 'Possible scheduling issues', 'Possible issues in communication with professors and TAs.\xa0', 'None. Actually prefer it as I get to do things on my schedule.\xa0', 'My main concern would be falling behind on work since I will have more responsibility for pacing myself. However, now that I have gotten a planner and set up a calendar for myself, I do not think this will be an issue. Other than that, I have no other concerns about taking this class remotely.', 'For impressions, I would say that I am rather intimidated by taking the course since I know nothing of linear algebra and have no prior knowledge. I am also not too familiar with matrices since I never really learned about them in my high school courses other than seeing very few matrix problems on the ACT. However, I am confident in my abilities and I believe that I will be just fine. Other than that, my individual needs really just encapsulate watching the lectures, taking notes, and doing plenty of practice problems to get better.', 'I am concerned about my ability to learn with primarily just watching videos. I feel like I learn better when I am in class and I can interact. I am just concerned that I will not be able to understand the concepts.', 'I am still confused how my school proctors exams.\xa0', 'Unable to thoroughly engage and ask questions (live)', 'I am worried I may lose track of assignment deadlines. Luckily, I was able to try and rectify this situation by exporting some of the course deadlines to Google Calendar!']
