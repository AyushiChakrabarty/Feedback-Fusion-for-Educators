      "that all of my knowledge from calc bc escapes my brain the sample exams and quizzes during linear algebra helped out a lot if we could have those for multivariable calc that would be fantastic my only concern about this course is that i will have an issue learning one of the fundamental items early in the course and as a result of that will struggle later on when building upon that foundational knowledge nan my only concern is if ill be able to studyprepare to the same degree for exams that i did last semester but other than that i feel confident nan my only concern is that so far the video lessons are not as clear as they were in the linear algebra course this could just be me though as they are still very comprehensive nan one thing that was concerning for me last semester was my mastery on certain topics there were some topics in linear algebra that i couldnt fully explore due to other work and activities for mv calc i hope to fix this issue by writing notes and practice problems down so that i could review it again in depth later nan perhaps not putting forth my greatest effort being a victim of senioritis ive always been a perfectionist so it is challenging and dreading to imagine not passing a class with flying colors nan some concerns may have might be more technical such as being unable to access the textbook nan some concerns that i have include encountering difficult content that would delay the process in which i complete assignments for the class nan something that concerns me is not being able to learn properly as it is not in person but i think the studio sessions and recorded lectures will resolve this nan studying for the exams nan taking module tests in mml nan technological issues with the gatech instructure portal nan that i wont do well because of all my other classes im scared i won succeed and miss a duedate nan that it counts towards my college gpa nan the allocation of the weightage nan the biggest concern i have this semester is preventing sernioritis from taking over and paralyzing my ability to finish work nan the concern i have is the format of the exams compared to linear algebra nan the effectiveness of studio lessons nan the exams concern me the most as i am unsure of the structure of the exams mainly if they are similar to last semesters course nan the exams since they are given such a large weight nan the lecture videos this semester skip a number of intermediate steps so the only mild concern i have right now is being unaware of where numbers may come from during the middle of her solving a problem nan the most concern is not fully understanding the content even with the help given and struggling due to the format and wording of some questions nan the one thing that concerns me is the high weightage of the exams and final nan the percentage for the exams concerns me the most as the high number puts pressure on students nan the quick pace of the lecture videos and occasional lack of explanation on a problem nan there has been some time since i worked on much of the calculus coursework so it may be a little rusty at the start of this semester nan theres mml courses old version and new i did mml on the new version but the grade didnt change in canvas when i do a question on the old version the grade updates nan too much homework na what concerns me most about taking the course is that the material may be a little difficult to learn since the course is online nan what concerns me the most about taking this course is being able to balance the large workload of this class along with the large workload of my other classes in a way that enables me to complete and do well on all this classs assignments while also gaining a strong understanding of the information that we are learning nan what concerns me the most about taking this course is not have sufficient time for completing all the material it is a very small concern nan it simply concerns me that i cannot ask my professor questions in person and is completely at the mercy of both my and the professors schedule na i found topics related to lagrange difficult last year and i feel like it will be hard for me to pick up on the content surrounding it i will look for extra help from tas and instructors no individual needs very excited to learn the topics in multivariable calculus my main concern is this is so so so much more difficult than high school math its really quite a jump and catches you off guard at first no nothing much matrices are my worst nighpcare and i hope they go away permanently also neither the written assignment nor the exams are appearing on my course feed and that is kind of an issue no nothing much matrices are my worst nighpcare and i hope they go away permanently i probably forgot a lot of calc bc nan i want to have more practice taking practice assessments and tests for prep i want to just have some more additional practice before the actual exams come around nan there might be several topics that rely on prerequisite knowledge that our school didnt address fully and i am unsure if there is an appropriate calculator for d information additionally exam and the final exam are during school holidayseventsexams so im unsure if that will work out well none nothing that ive seen but i have heard from several others who have taken the course in the past about the difficulty of this semester none i am glad there are not quizzes anymore and just mmls as they were far more helpful to me in linear algebra i do not have any concerns none the difficulty multivariable calculus sounds like a very advanced class none one concern for taking this course is having a greater workload even though the work provided based on the modules is less not applicable the amount of work nothing so far just only started the abstractions sometimes scare me nothing i am very excited im afraid i wont be able to retain the information i learn well enough to be able to teach it to someone else teaching it to someone else helps me understand better so im afraid that i wont be able to understand to that level the course seems a little more rigorous but i think if i just reach out when i need help ill be alright the concerns that i have taking the course are the varied amount of work that each unit would take and the format of the module tests for example i am anxious that the test content may be from a unit that was covered briefly from many lessons ago that i may not have had time to review for the course so far is navigable and allows me time to work on the assignment i think im most concerned about getting an a in the course and being able to balance the workload with all my other commipcents however i felt the workload with linear algebra was optimal and i am now finished with college applications so i doubt that will be too much of a problem there is nothing in particular i think you should know about me or my impressions of the course so far the only concern i have is the difficulty with the course knowing that many people have said that it will be very hard however i feel like itll be alright considering my performance in linear algebra there is nothing individually that i would need i very much like the course so far because of its similarity to the layout of the linear algebra course i do not have any concerns at the moment there is nothing so far last year i struggled a lot with true and false questions and concerned that i might repeat the same thing this semester nan the tests being in mml makes them difficult to complete on mobile nan i wish that every single question on the homework had a walk you through it or an example nan i would like to focus on retaining the material better since i find it harder to retain the information as well for online courses nan im a bit worried about the content and the difficulty nan im a little concerned as to whether or not i will be able to understand many of the topics we learn about but im also confident that i will put in my best nan im just a little intimidated by how much the exams and final are worth nan im slightly concerned about preparing from exams but i know that i can look at practice exams and mml practice to study and ensure that i understand the material nan my biggest concern is keeping up with the deadlines especially because the gt breaks do not align with school breaks so i will make sure to stay on schedule nan my concern is the extra exam we have compared to last semester last semester there was two exams and the final but with the extra exam i am worried about how it will all work out nan my only concern is if it will add too much to my course load this semester nan one concern i have about this course is that i forgot much of what i learned in calculus last year however i believe i will able to review the material that is necessary for this course and will regain the skills nan one concern or dislike i have is the canvas quizzes are taken away these helped support my learning and understanding of the content much more nan that its been a while since ive done calculus i personally feel it would have been better to have multivar first semester unless line alg is a prerequisite then ignore this nan the one thing that concerns me the most is the fact that the inperson exams are worth more than in linear algebra nan the only thing that concerns me about this course is that my calculus foundation is not strong i believe last semester my strong algebra foundation helped me a lot in linear algebra but this semester i am concerned about how my weak calculus foundation will impact my learning pace nan the only thing that worries me is that since this is mostly an online class i might not get as much practice as i should inperson nsetting math requires a lot of practice hence it is important that i get in sufficient practice before any of the assessments nan the tests are of our grade we dont have quizzes anymore and grades arent dropped nan the thing that concerns me the most is having a smaller diversity of practice problems i dont want to use the exam prep sheets before i begin studying for the exam but i would also like practice problems besides what is on mml the extra credit webwork will hopefully cover this but it doesnt become available until the nd nan the weight of the exams worries me for getting a good grade nan the workload this is a college class so i will definitely have a lot more work here than in any of my other classes nan the increased complexity of the actual technical math work compared to linear algebra i struggled occasionally in bc calculus so multivariable is daunting in comparison na so far the course feels alright but i will only really know about my impressions on its technical difficulty as we get farther in i feel like the exams concern me since last semester we had also the final being worth of the grade is a lot in my opinion since i have never had a test weigh more nan i got a b last semester and i heard this class can be harder so im worried about that nan i think its just the leap from weekly homeworks to mass studying a few days before exams nan i think my time management skills are the most concerning preparing well before a test and studying consistently i should manage my time well nan i worry about falling behind in content nan im a bit worried about the inperson examinations as they will now take up of our grade other than that i am not too worried nan im afraid about the difficulty of this course but that was also the same for last semesters calculus especially series was a struggle and i understand that i will do better if i put in more effort but i still feel like im going to stress over learning nan im concerned about the level of importance for the exams being now and im also worried for the lack of quizzes since those were helpful nan im concerned the course may move quickly and that i will have to review calculus which i may have forgotten since last year nan im concerned with my calculus knowledge i took ab and bc last year and havent done much review since nan im most concerned that i will not understand the material being taught and that i wont be able to execute my knowledge during the exams i hope to mitigate this by consistently doing practice exams to prepare myself for the actual exam nan im worried i might have forgotten some of the stuff that the course expects me to know nan in linear algebra i got into a groove with my coursework i feel like it is going to be a lot different with this course it is a different kind of math there are no quizzes there are three exams and the lecturer is different my biggest concern is that the lady on the lecture videos does not do as great of a job as dr mayer did with linear algebra nan my biggest concern is actually understanding the course content so far it seems a decent bit complicated and i know its only going to get harder nan i concerned about getting a b like last semester although i feel more confident in this courses material for reasons previously stated i need to make sure i stay on task and adequately review material nan i dont have a lot of concerns about this course mainly just worrying about how well ill learn the material nan i am slightly concerned for the lack of a practice exam i am very excited to be back in a calculus class i am concerned about the pace of the course and the difficulty of the concepts taught throughout the course nan i am nervous i will think i will understand the topic but ultimately fail the exams nan i am concerned about the calculus portion as it relates to derivatives and integrals although i was proficient in it the concept can become quite complex nan im concerned that i might have some difficulty learning onlinenot being able to ask questions as easily as i would be able to in a inperson class nan as this course is going to mix linear algebra and calculus im worried about the content however i plan to attend more studio sessions to fully understand this content nan at this point in the semester i am most concerned about studying for the exams as i am worried that my current studying techniques will be ineffective given the amount of content involved in an exam more specifically the final exam nan at this point in the semester true and false questions concern me the most in this course as i do not do as well with conceptual questions luckily dr mayer mentioned that math is less theoretical so i am hoping it will be less difficult this semester nan i am a bit concerned about the difficulty of the course and the things i will need to do to manage my time with my other classes nan i am most concerned about being able to learn online because i struggled last semester and had to do a lot of group studying to understand some parts nan i am concerned about the lack of guidance from an inperson teacher i often rely on asking the teacher questions to improve my understanding of certain concepts nan i am concerned about the lack of quizzes the quizzes in the linear algebra course helped me test my knowledge and i am not sure why this course does not have any nan i am concerned because ive heard that this is the hardest of all distance math classes so im scared that i wont understand something and wont do too well given that all exams combined are of our grade nan i am concerned by the fastmoving pace of the course but i believe with appropriate practice i will be able to gain a strong information of the content nan i am concerned that i will not understand a concept and it will affect me for the rest of the course nan i am concerned that i will struggle on exams with the lack of quizzes that i can retry like we could last semester it showed me where to work more and promoted mastery of all subjects nan i am most concerned about getting behind on my work and getting stressed out however that did not happen last semester so hopefully it doesnt this semester either nan i am most concerned about not understanding the course and not doing well on exams nan i am most concerned with keeping up with the course there is often much math to cover each week so it is important that i manage my time well so that i am able to sufficiently understand and apply the material nan i am worried about the exams being worth of the grade this time and i want to make sure i spend an even longer time studying for the exams i am concerned about making sure i fully learn all the content this semester because i feel like semester it was easy to get by without fully learning the content until the exams nan i am worried about the in person exams the most in linear algebra i struggled to prepare well enough to see results despite studying so i am worried that i will have the same struggles in this class nan i am concerned about being able to recall things from calculus quick enough to understand the new concepts in the course nan i am concerned about how much practice i will have to do using resources outside of the work given by this course once the topics become more complex nan i am concerned about the exams because they have a much higher weight in this class and the exams in linear algebra were hard for me i am also concerned that i lost a lot of my knowledge of bc calculus since it has been a while nan although i said i enjoy the incorporation of physics it also could be a challenge for me im not the greatest at physics but it is just going to have to be part of the process and ill take more time to understand how to use it in this class nan as the last time i had practiced calculus was months ago i am a bit worried about my ability to remember the application of certain skills nan at this point im not worried about the difficulty of the work im worried about the timing of it since my spring semester looks like it will be busier than fall semester nan grades nan i am a bit concerned that unlike linear algebra there are not quizzes due each week those quizzes not only helped to bolster my grade but they were extremely useful to better understanding content i will likely need to seek other sources for better understanding this semester nan i am concerned about not learning the content as deeply as i need to even after watching lecture videos and reading the textbook and doing the homework there are still times where i struggle to keep up nan i am concerned about taking another calculus class because i have forgotten just about all of the calculus i took previously nan i am concerned about the fact that the in person exams count for so much gradewise which means i dont have very much room for error on the exams nan i am concerned about the lack of quizzes with linear algebra i thought that the quizzes helped to reinforce understanding and acted as review material down the line nan i am most concerned about not understanding the material nan i heard some concepts are difficult to grasp but otherwise no major concerns nan i tend to struggle with online courses and staying engaged so im concerned about that if im able to put in the time though the material should be fairly easy for me nan i wasnt the best at calc bc and continuing calculus is a bit nervous for me but im pretty confident with vectors and their related topics so im not too worried nan im mostly concerned about the difficulty students generally have mixed opinions about the difficulty of multivariable calculus as compared to linear algebra so i hope that multi isnt too much more challenging than linalg nan my concern now is that the exams hold a higher portion in the overall weight grade but i believe with proper work and attention to learning that shouldnt be a problem im also a bit worried because there are no quizzes each week so i feel like i cant have that extra review i would normally have to learn the part that concerns me the most is that we dont have module exams anymore which were helpful to me in the previous semester but hopefully the kahoots can make up for that nan not having enough practice without the weekly quizzes having to learn harder content greater amount of grade based on exams nan not having weekly quizzes is a concern to me as they were helpful in gauging our knowledge for the exams last semester additionally the percentage of exam weight is a slight bit of a concern to me as last semester i wasnt the best at examtaking nonetheless i will work this semester to be better nan i am worried about having another exam i did well on exams and during linear algebra but they always make me nervous na im concerned about not being able to attend the live lessons last semester i was able to watch recordings for the first quarter but then i ended up stop watching the lessons altogether and just relied on the lesson videos and textbook na ill ask a lot of questions i guess i am a bit scared about how there are three exams this year instead of two like last year but i know it will work out as long as i work hard na i am also a little worried about the fact that there are fewer assignments especially with there being no quizzes this means there will be fewer practices and easy as to affect our grades i am also worried about the fact that there is another exam because exams are not my strong point in this course so this could drop my grade no concerns i am concerned about my ability to fully understand the subject material math does not come easy to me especially math at this level so i am also worried about the time i will have to dedicate to succees nan ensuring that i study enough before the first exam is my main concern as i am still learning how much time i need to spend reviewing for collegiate level courses such as this one nan there are no quizzes every week i like to use the quizzes for practice and as a checkpoint but now itll be that much harder to study for the exams not that i can think of i am most concerned about finishing learning and understanding the content before the exams roll around because there seems to be more content than last semester the first b of my high school career was in math so i hope that motivates me to push harder for an a this semester i am mostly concerned about being able to fully grasp the content but that is mostly based on my own personal ability to learn and take the time to study for this course there is not really anything special concerning my needs except that my internet at home can sometimes stop working but i will do my best to not let this issue affect my work in the course being able to pass the exam nan i have no concerns yet nan na na nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan na nan none nan none nan nan nan none nan none nan i have enjoyed the course so far in which i am not concerned about the course at this current moment i am looking forward to the continuation of the course as well na my impressions of the course are great na na i just need to pace myself and not get overwheaced with all of the course if i have any questions i need to make sure to go to office hours to get them answered nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

far nan the pacing of the lecture videos is impeccable do keep the pace it is fantastic none there is nothing specific i think my main concern is that i wont be able to attend a lot of the studio sessions last semester i did try to attend a few but i didnt attend as much as i liked i hope that this semester ill be able to keep track of the schedule and attend when i can nan i will not be able to take exam due to spring break nan one of the exams is scheduled for our winter break nan one of the in person exams is on my schools spring break but other than that none as of right now nan im concerned about not knowing the dates of the tests yet im afraid i might miss a test date i also dont learn very well from watching lecture videos i learn much better from facetoface instruction so that could be a problem nan nothing concerns me much at the moment but one of the exams is during spring break which confuses me nan i am very concerned about the date for exam in the syllabus it says students should take exam under supervision of their facilitator any time on wednesday apr the entire week of april th is spring break for my school it doesnt line up with ga techs spring break i only know a few counties but that week is spring break for at least dekalb forsyth fulton and cobb but i assume there are others with this same issue im just worried especially since my family had planned a vacation out of state that week is there a plan for schools that are out the week of april th nan my concerns are just having it be selfguided and not having much guidance in addition exams are worth more this semester nan the distance learning was a bit of a struggle for me last semester and the removal of the weekly quizzes is a little frustrating since those helped me learn more specifics nan writing my zs and having them look like s nan theres always debates concerning whether linear algebra or multivariable calculus is more difficult which sort of scares me linear algebra has definently challenged me and required me to think harder about math and if some people say multivariable is harder i have no idea what this semester is going to look like there are no questions yet keeping myself accountable and managing my time wisely nan keeping up the motivation to balance learning and completing assignments alongside other commipcents nan the only thing that really concerns me would be time management while taking the course my senior year i can solve this by planning out my weeks nan i feel like there might be a point in time where i lose time management and start to stress out nan im worried i will fall behind nan im a little worried about how much of calculus i remember but ill review na im concerned i wont time manage nan keeping up with the pace of information and watching all lectures nan my concerns are my ability to manage my time to prepare for exams adequately nan i am worried that i will get behind and do poorly on exams due to senioritis math is one of my favorite subjects but i am not particularly fond of proofs i am concerned whether i will be able to keep up with this course and distance cs i hope i can stay ahead and turn in assignments before they are due nan after last semester im most concerned about getting behind on learning material however this is definitely a personal issue of procrastination and im feeling a lot better after reorganizing how i study so i dont get overwheaced nan i have no major concerns but the exams are a lot sooner than last year so the time crunch will be a bit worse nan im worried about balancing time between my internship other classes robotics and this class nan the only thing i am worried about with this class is the workload i am a participant in my high schools theatre program so a lot of my time will be spent rehearsing for our production in may i plan to combat the stress of a heavy workload by staying ahead and attending office hours when i am struggling so i can get clarity before it is too late na i think that last semester gave me a good idea of how the course would function so i am prepared for this upcoming semester i am concerned that i will become complacent closer to the end of the course and not be as focused on studying or completing assignments nan i am concerned that i will fall behind and in turn not learn some of the material well enough to perform well on the exams nan i am concerned that the work load will become quite a bit when there is a lot of content packed into a week nan i am concerned with how fast it is going and that i may not be able to keep up with the topics and material nan i am concerned with pacing for this course since many people who have taken this course in years prior have warned me about certain weeksmodules taking significantly longer than others nan i am mostly concerned about the amount of material to be consumed in a short amount of time nan i am worried about the difficulty level of this course and my time management nan i am concerned about pacing myself with my work well this semester nan being able to balance the college workload with my other high school senior responsibilities nan being on schedule and reviewing before a test in time nan i am concerned about my ability to effectively manage my time so that i study enough to understand all the material for exams nan i concerned that i will procrastinate again however i am going to try much harder this semester and get an a nan im concerned about getting behind on my work since its an online course its very easy to not look at the work for a while and forget about it nan im playing on the soccer team this year so managing my time will be more important and may be a challenge for me nan keeping up with work and live studio sessions as this was a struggle last semester nan my concern is that i will not have enough time to keep up with such a rigorous course and complete each homework assignment each week but to combat that i will make sure to keep up with due dates and hold myself accountable for the work i need to get done nan nothing regarding like the formatting of it or being able to find content but maybe just personally how i will do with procrastination nan personally i would put na however in the back corner of my mind that monkey brain of mine loves to procrastinate i would love to not do that so i guess that would be my concern na the material from last course was more than exceptional i am most concern about remembering all the content and understanding the content in general because if i do not understand some part of the content at the beginning i am afraid i will quickly fall behind no there is nothing i would like to mention im worried that out of my own bad habits im going to start cramming material which is something i dont want im also slightly more concerned about taking the exams because compared to last semester theres one more and since they make up of my grade im paranoid not really not getting ahead on work concerns me since im taking a research class and i dont want the work to accumulate there is nothing the final exam concerns me the most about taking this course as it lowered my grade drastically last semester i would like to know if there will be as many practice tests similar to the last semester absolutely the exams and tests i do poorly under pressure i live in fulton county and also participate in orchestra exam date overlaps with an important allday event for orchestra lgpe exam date overlaps with spring break for fulton county and is also my birthday none im too smart i miss your voice greg please come back i need you nan regarding my individual needs i have an unstable home environment ive gone through the process of talking to the dean of students i would like the mmls to show up in the modules like they did for qhs i would like the mmls to show up in the modules like they did for qhs while i completed ap calculus abbc last year i am afraid i may have forgot the material so i need refreshing for multivariable calculus i am excited to learn the applications of multivariable calculus and compare and contrast multivariable calculus with my prior knowledge maybe the fact that the tests are nocalculator its a little daunting i am not the greatest with learning online as opposed to facetoface but nonetheless i am excited for this course and am ready to work hard i wonder when the difficulty jump will be because i am aware that it seems to start simple but will get much harder i dont have any unique individual needs what concerns me the most is staying focused throughout the whole semester to understand the material as my other classes get difficult as well i loved ap calculus so im really looking forward to expand my knowledge on calculus even further my biggest concern is not knowing all of the assignments or resources i need to utilize it would be horrible if i found out i missed an assignment or an extra credit opprotunity i might not be able to attend live studio sessions because of after school hours but i will try to watch all of the recordings i just hope i can get a better grasp of concepts than i had last semester so that my grade can better reflect my capabilities i struggled a lot last semester as there wasnt really peers i could turn towards for any sort of help as my school has very few people in this course and those people dont really help each other out my concerns include the heavy weight of the exams however with disciplined preparation i believe it is possible to achieve success in this course i tend to get quite nervous before exams however i do my best to get help when neededwork my way through problems to get deep understanding of course materials i believe course material is more spaced out as compared to linear however i believe the content is more rigorous so i will need to ensure that i remain uptospeedahead on all course content its been a while since ive done any calculus so i might be rusty on some skills i think multivariable calculus will be a more advanced form of calculus that i learned in ap my main concern in striving for a a in this class i find that i struggle to learn something unless i view it in many different lenses so the videos textbook and studio sessions will definitely help i will be in india from jan feb and so i will be trying to get ahead in the early weeks of this course im just worried about learning everything well enough to apply it in later courses but hopefully if i watch lectures and studios and do practice problems i wont have an issue with that im looking forward to the extra credit practice problems understanding concepts like partial derivatives multiple integrals and vector calculus can be difficult for me second the course may require a significant amount of computational work and problem solving which can be timeconsuming and challenging im very interested in physics and this class will definitely help pursue my passion in that field my biggest concern is my ability to learn the material and pace myself this semester will be more hectic than last semester making it more difficult to dedicate time to learning the material ive learned a lot from the first segment of distance math in terms of what to expect with assignments and pacing so im not as worried about that this time around one thing that i will be experiencing this semester is going to india for two weeks for a family event which may interfere with the course something that concerns me is how everything builds in this unit like if i dont understand one unit then itll snowball into other units not ending up too well math is somewhat of a struggle for me but ill try my best this semester im concerned with how it is based heavily on calculus especially considering how difficult bc calculus was last year im also scared that we will be expected to remember things from last year that i might not remember how to do this course is also said to be covering more than linear algebra so it will go faster and im scared that i will get lost or confused or that it might go too fast for me i think the breakdown of the linear algebra course really helped me so i am going to try to follow and trust the breakdown of this course as well my impression of the course so far is pretty good ive heard that it is less theoretical and thus less complicated than the linear algebra course i am looking forward to solving more porblems instead of memorizing rules and definitions i am a little overwhlemed by the amount of content we will cover but i believe that as we go through it ill be alright with the piece by piece what concerns me the most about taking this course is the proximity of the exams in terms of time my impression of the course so far is that it is a selftaught course my ability to stay focused and perform in an online setting my main concern has been keeping up with the work and managing studying i am most concerned about the exam questions matching the lesson coverage i am impressed by the application of the concepts i am concerned about the inperson exams and whether i will be prepared for them with plenty of practices i am someone who asks a lot of questions and needs clarifications i am most concerned about getting behind like last semester and doing things the day they are due so i am going to try and stay better on track this semester i am also concerned about retaining all of the information for subsequent courses i am very excited to see how linear algebra and multi build on each other and our understanding of mathematics i am a little worried about taking the exams on different days but i have been talking to my facilitator and you i am concerned about falling behind the daily videos as i struggled with this towards the end of last semester in linear algebra i believe that this course will be really funenjoyable or at least more so than linear algebra as that was more conceptual and i enjoy being able to visualize the math functions from my experience last semester i felt very unprepared for the final and did not receive the grade that i wanted besides that this course seems reasonable so far i have heard alot about mvc from prior friends who have already taken this course and it seems like a very interesting course i was very proficient at calculus and want to learn more about the subject as a whole considering more variables i am concerned about balancing the work needed for this course with other classes and extracurriculars i have also heard that this course is more difficult than linear algebra which worries me somewhat i look forward to completing this course and learning about multivariable calculus i am concerned about understanding the topic and receiving an a i may need some assistance at some point or will have questions later in the course i am concerned with my ability to master the material on my own i feel i can do well on the quizzes but i feel less confident on the true and false questions i sometimes have trouble with the theoretical questions i really appreciate it when extra practice is posted for review before tests and exams i have no concerns about this course everything so far has been quite simple i have no individual needs towards the course nothing im mainly just excited since i enjoyed my first calculus classes all ive heard about the course is that if you enjoy calculus then you should do fine none at the moment i do not have anything nan i am interested and looking forwards to learning calculus nan i am on the autism spectrum and in general require basic accommodations for testing time and a half and a separate testing room i dont quite know who to contact about this i do not have any real concerns i do not have any individual needs nan i dont think i have any needs ive taken java script and now cs so i feel pretty confident in my knowledge of how programming works none i have no concerns nan i have no extenuating circumstances for this course but in general i dont love online classes and which there was more of an emphasis on the writing assignments instead of hw assignments i have no concerns about taking this course i have nothing to inform you about my personal needs or impressions nan i heard that linear algebra was harder than multivariable calculus from multiple people so im expecting multi to be a little easier to grasp and understand than linear algebra nan i really like linear algebra i am hoping to use the same studying and working ethics for this course none last year i enjoyed ap calculus abbc and i am excited to continue enriching my knowledge of calculus i am concerned about how much of linear algebra content will be used in this course that was not a good course for me i am excited to begin this course no other concerns i am a bit worried because due to my work i miss many of the studio sessions and while i ant to complete the worksheets and watch the videos i have trouble effectively checking my work a centralized location with all of the studio worksheet answers would be very useful especially when i redo the worksheets to prepare for the final exam im excited to start i have heard that mvc has a heavier workload than linear algebra if this is true i hope to manage my time wisely to get everything done in a punctual manner i am really excited to delve into this course ap calculus abbc has been my favorite high school class thus far and i am looking forward to exploring the different concepts that mvc will expand on this semester in the end of my senior year of high school balancing the rigor of this course with all of the other assignments i have due in my other classes studying for ap tests and getting ready for college will make this class challenging for me but i am excited to take the class on as long as i maintain good healthy study strategies i believe all that would come up is just coordinating when to take exams with the other students at my school taking this class i remember one of the exams had to be administered to my school a few days after it was to most other students organizing exam dates will be something i will need to be proactive about im concerned about falling behind on assignments and not being able to catch up i often cant get notifications for my gt email to work so i may miss some things i worry about my procrastination habits i think i will need additional resources regarding word problems and conceptual work because that was my weakest area in linear algebra keeping up with weekly work and avoiding procrastination i think linear algebra has served as a good prerequisite to multivariable calc due to its applications in this spring course i am a little concerned about falling behind the schedule and then having to rush to learn the concepts i will try to maintain a consistent work session to ensure i perform my best however i am enjoying the course so far and believe that if i need any help that i can access it easily through studio sessions and piazza i think i am concerned about understanding the content and managing my time i want to be able to fully understand each of the lessons but im scared that i might not be able to im also worried about finding the time to watch all the lessons and do adequate practice for each of them i dont think theres anything that i need from you specifically i think i just have to learn to manage my time and get my assignments done to be successful in this class i am concerned that i will get sidetracked by other things such as my ib exams and not give this course the attention it needs however i am currently preparing to make sure that does not happen i love the class\n"
